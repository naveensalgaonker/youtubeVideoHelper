all right let me said the context this video is specifically for people who are feeling a little stuck being in the tech industry that could mean you don't have a job or you have a very low paying job or you don't really feel super productive at your job you feel like you're overpaid for the work that you're doing in this video I would urge you to take a pause and think about few of the topics that I'm talking about and and see if you really feel you're a fit for the industry or if you want to stick in this industry or you know there are better things to pursue other than the tech industry um why do I feel qualified to do this because in this very wavy Market where you know everyone thinks like no one's getting employed um I've run this batch offline now of around 50 people and 80% of the lot has been placed U and it's becoming really hard for me to place the last 20% so there's like clear differences that I see in the 80% and the 20% this is not a TST on the 20% I'm sure the 20% will eventually recover or you know something good may or may not happen for them but amongst the 80% a few people had some very specific uh traits and the ones who did not they were either pushed through those traits or you know just got lucky U but in the end um In This Very aggressively scary Market um I've been able to deliver outcomes that even I did not imagine um this is not a promotion in any way I you don't have to join any of my courses SL you know the offline batch this is just me trying to understand myself you know what exactly is happening and why are people you know why is there very bipolar outcomes on where the tech industry is going one being you know everything seems great and you know I have a job or you know I'm learning new things every day and the other being one I'm not learning new things two I'm stuck in a very weird Centum um of you know will I get a job not get a job will this get replaced completely and lastly U some lack of effort SL complacency that I feel um exists in this industry the video specifically has 10 points um it's overall divided into three parts the first part is for you know complete n layers if you feel Tech is a bad industry I will agree with you and you know I'll give you a few points as to what was happening why is it happening and you know great this the wor industry in the world to join um then I'm going to sh some points around you know people who might feel like they want to stay SL you know feel like this is a industry SL have a lot of interest in computer science and the last set of points are around Ai and you know what its future may or may not be what happens if you know AI comes and takes everyone's stop let's get right into it the first point is around information Arbitrage and supply and demand um what you need to realize is every job SL value SL business U purely runs on supply and demand you will make a lot of money there's a lot of demand for your product and unfortunately you know you know in the last few years what happened was there was a lot of demand for companies that weren't making money SL did not have proven business models it was a very former driven Market when it came to VCS so VCS would invest left right and Center in any company that would May that may or may not provide value in the future and then those companies would compete for talent in a very similar fashion where they would form more into getting Talent which led to very unrealistic expectations um it felt like Tech is a great industry to be in because you did not have to do anything not have to provide any value yet you would get compensated really heavily um that was true for businesses that was true for employees um this is pure Supply demand people were in a lot of foro to hire Engineers to invest in future looking companies that may do well and that led to a lot of capital being infused U very high probability that does not happen again or if it happens it happens you know in a very weirdish market like AI we or some new market that grows up it will most probably not happen generally in Tech again for a while for the next 10 years or so so that will lead to you having to provide value to a company to be able to get a job a company having to provide value to a vc/ being able to build a business to be able to run profitably over a few years um this shouldn't be unobvious uh but it became un obvious because you know we all saw euphoric times and we're just hoping those come back but there's a high probability they don't so you should prepare for the worst case and assume the market will stay like it is and you will not see you know euphoric times again for a really long time that leads me to the second point which is shying away from providing a lot of on ground value um I think since we have this expectation of you know everyone gets hired in Tech which honestly either is not happening anymore and even if it is slash you are one of those Engineers who's fairly complacent in your job and drawing a 300K salary in SF or you know 50 LPA in in Bangalore um unfortunately you know there's a high probability that either those job gets replaced or your pay plateus at some point you know if your value that you're providing is not equivalent to your salary or more there's a high probability you will plate SL get kicked out that happens very often you know most people plate to at an L3 or an L4 or an L5 in a big Tech or in finance you don't get bonuses if you're not performing well that's a clear sign for you to you know leave the company and the same thing I'm seeing prej job as well um if there's a job application that has you know a th000 applicants and if there's an assignment that you have to do then maybe 2 to 3% is actually doing the assignment and maybe 1% is you know actually delivering an assignment that's readable I saw a LinkedIn tweet just now where he's the founder said 40 people applied 10 people did the assignment three assignments were good two of them were great and only one did something extra to finally get the job um that's what value is like that's very value driven hiring I saw this in video making recently can we put out a post to hire an editor and we gave an assignment zero people submitted the assignment only one person submitted that also he submitted a reference video that we shared as such he did not put in any efforts um I don't get why that happens I'll share another example um yesterday I was at the super Labs campus and I connected someone to a company he got an assignment and his assignment deadline was 10:00 p.m. at 8:00 p.m. he was attending a class that I was taking and I was asking why are you attending this class to I mean a few points that I got from him work his reply is very weird he might not hire I'm like that does not mean you don't put in the effort I totally get there's another side to this that people get free work out of you know in and a uh through assignments but just judge the company and you know don't shy away from doing assignments if you are doing that then probably there's something missing right you're scared you will not be able to provide value or you're just hoping someone just you know hires you without any or just on the basis of an interview or without providing any value up that'll get harder and harder trial periods are becoming so common super 30 at least 50% of the selections got trial periods of 2 weeks you have to show value in those two weeks I don't know why people are shying away from this this is what you were preparing for right this is what you wanted to do you wanted to be in CS you wanted to do coding you wanted a job why are you so worried about you know a trial period of 2 weeks where you're going to just do the thing that you're eventually going to do anyways um and this is very common if there are 100 people applying as I said maybe five people are doing the assignment well and during a trial period maybe even further I'm not saying you most people want something handed to them for free I'm sure people are willing to put in efforts but like limited efforts if I'm providing value of one L I'll I don't know this is indan mindset you know I will not work for more than the value that I'm providing but I mean if you want to be in CS I wouldn't shy away from providing more value than I'm being paid um it will help you one retain your job and two if you feel like the company is underpaying you U the work that you're doing eventually might lead to a better job you will get some leverage from your you know existing company the work that you're doing in your next job though I would strongly recommend if you are applying left right and Center to 100 companies maybe try reading through what assignment they're trying to do maybe try looking at their code base and providing some value it's very hard to hire good engineers and this has been said for years and years and it's still true it respective of you know how many Engineers are there in the market SL even C Engineers are there in the market almost every other company tells me okay I just can't find that good engineer it's like you're not competing with a lot you're competing with you know 1% there's a very controversial other side to this that I did not want to talk about I still talk about it but a lot of companies have to maintain you know let's say 10% women or 20% women to they have this women criteria or wom only hirings though as a woman it's slightly easier because you're competing with a woman lot and not a lot of women job Tech thankfully you know for a woman or you know other genders other than male it's it is a little easier it's a fact that does not mean they're not putting in efforts it's just that they have to compete with that lot for you um if you're you know not a female then you have to compete with the lot the N lot even though there are numbers there is not a lot of substance in those numbers when it comes to a lot of things um one being you know pure hard work/ providing value before joining SL having an employee mindset I'm joining to provide value and you know B get a salary uh I think everyone wants to be a billionaire today or you know start their startup I don't know what it is or everyone's lazy one maybe that's another point but but long story short um don't shy away from providing value this is something I'm seeing very commonly and that might be one of the reasons you know you're feeling stuck SL complacent on to the next point this one is around unfair advantage and this one's again controversial um because firstly what is unfair Advantage it's going to a good college um a good example here is almost every friend I know know um back in college got into gck um I did gck my partner back in college did gck my sister did gck um every friend that I had did gck my SDS Labs group had like 13 g-o selections I RI that year had 43 gck Selections in one year um believe it or not it's you know the community that's causing this there's a reason it's noted to it a lot of tier3 colleges also have you know ICPC every year that happens because of the community that is an fa Advantage um it does help I would probably say super 30 people also had a little bit of unfair Advantage you know whatever the referrals that were coming to me were aggressively getting pushed to them SL you know whatever everyone around them was getting played so they had some pressure that Community whatever that reason might be could be pressure could be whatever the reason was that does help another great unfair Advantage is having a father or a friend who's in Tech or a brother who's in Tech like a real sibling you will see these people become prodig lot of 14y olds that code really well most probably their parents are also in Tech um so these are good unfair advantages um if you don't have them a lot of people have them and they don't even notice U and I think a lot of the people that are watching the video do not have them um I think if you're stuck most probably you don't have that community that brother that senior that parent that's you know in Tech that can guide you very well so here comes another if you stuck there here comes a suggestion with feel free to not take it all of these are my opinions you don't have to agree to them/ share them but there's this recent post that I saw where someone was paying for referrals um if I was unemployed today I would take them um I'm not suggesting you take them but that is another unfair Advantage if you can pay someone whatever that P say 2,000 Rupees and in return of that at least you know help let them interview you so they you know whether or not you're you know qualified enough to get that job and if they give you referral even better but I think more than that if you don't have that Network a lot of times you have to pay for that Network um you don't have to everything is free I totally agree CS should be free 100% but if I was unemployed or you know sling a tier three College SL even in a good college but not getting a job I would not shy away from doing this I know it's scary U it was a very scary decision for me back in the day to pay for itj tution but that small thing or you know whatever that Feast was helped me get into an it which did pay out I think in the end if back then I would have shied away I wouldn't even know I saved 50,000 rupes by not paying for it tutions but now I know since I paid for that even if I don't know the teachers were bad let's say the exam everything was bad but whatever that was it led me to preach here if you have to pay for Access um if you have to pay for substance if you have to pay for someone who's connects better than you you should I'm not saying buy any of my things don't I'm just saying by B Buu friend it will help a lot of times they know some things they'll tell you one thing like maybe maybe one sentence but that might materialize into something really big in the future so don't shy away from that India has a very conservative mindset that way can we try to save P can we try to pinch pennies everywhere um would not recommend it but again it's your choice and I totally agree everything should be for free so you know let let's agree um on that point so this one's related to the last Point u i see a few these comments that say which means you know life is so unfair uh people who are already rich get richer someone who can pay for a you know access like this or for a referral uh is the one who's getting a job so how will people who don't have money proceed they'll always remain poor um to to I to that I say I think motivation matters the most um if you are motivated enough I think there's nothing you can't do um but this point is not for those people this point is for people who let's say have a lot of money and can afford for Access so I would suggest a few things U pay for Access U that means the if you have a lot of money I would suggest for your undergrad go to the US U don't even have to go for an undergrad just go to the US if you're 18 19 or 17 year old and you know be in SF for a while you'll learn something new there you'll get some access uh that you will not get over here that's where you know a lot of the future software is being built if I had a lot of money today if I was 17 18 19 20 um I would move to SF for a few weeks or you know I don't know probably SF is the only place maybe Bangalore you know if you don't have that much money but a little bit U these are good places to be in um and these ecosystems might teach you something that will very be very hard for you to get otherwise so if you can't if you have a lot of money then this point is for you if you don't have a lot of money always remember motivation kills everything else and you know you'll be fine you'll be richer than everyone else rajab raaja so on and so forth but if you do U SF is a great place to be in all of my call them you know Canadian cousins Friends u have moved to SF and the the kind of I mean they're not really rich today or anything you know it's not like they all of them have 200k offers but it's very obvious to see they will eventually um will either start their own company or you know in the worst case get into a replate a you know some startup over there and and do well so if you can afford it I mean if you even if you can afford a trip to SF move there for you know 3 4 months and try to meet as many people as possible that takes us to the next Point what differentiated the 80% from the 20% like there there were only a few points in super 30 when I felt a lot of anxiety that was when someone who was really good um and I noticed they were really good and I did not have companies to place them in um I have a few names at the back of my head but tul guar is one guy uh aay is one guy um rishab is one guy these guys are really good um so you know what made me feel that they're really good what what is that Tipping Point and I think in Tech eventually the people that will survive will be the people who are above this Tipping Point um this is a very simple answer that they're just very hardworking they probably have some CS intellect also um and they're super focused on the input and not on the output um they just at the back of their head know okay output um maybe let's not talk about this side let's talk about the other side there are people who I've deferred like two three times but they weren't able to get in so every time they have like a very common is excuse it's somewhere around the lines of I had a family issue I had a college examination I get very anxious during an interview um but I think I agree on the family points and health points I think you know that's totally possible but this is like something I commonly hear um to baring those points I think if if you feel like you're you know getting nervous in an interview I'll tell you what the 80% did right or you know why they were able to impress me yeah I felt you know I need to refer them as soon as possible um they were very confident in their answers um they would question me also like I'm not doing deep next J you know on a day-to-day basis so when I would ask an interview question um and I would go deeper and deeper at some point they would say something that I did not know that was enough sign for me to know has gone into the depths of something I think there's a lot of people who have surface level knowledge um everyone can build a you know a website today or whatever it's very easy I will do it at 5 minutes uh but as you dive into the code base you ask people to explain their own code a lot of people are not able to do it though the the short answer here is um you should be able to write code yourself even though an AI can help you um and you should understand internally what is happening you shouldn't have a lot of surface L knowledge um you should dive deeper into bead languages bead Frameworks eventually the people who you know this will become harder and harder to reach the stipping point people at the top will have more and more knowledge that bar of being a good engineer will increase um so I think the thing that might be missing um in you you might be just going into the depths of of languages doing CS for interest honestly U if you do CS for interest all of this just becomes an outcome um another good example is I gave a devop assignment recently in super 30 and like you could tell the first person who was able to solve all of them was serum then the second person who dated was sujit who are both TS and super 30 third person who dated was U sharat um who's you know one of the good guys who got pleased that you know it's very obvious basically if you throw an assignment at a few people in a room um it's very obvious to tell who's good and who's not know that leader would sort of you can create of course if no one's using AI or no one's cheating um you can just talk to them and tell who's good or not um and why is serum good because he's you know very interested in computer science why is sharat good because he used to do LX back in the day if you don't have core interest right either build it so if you're not able to build core interest you'll probably not lie on the other side you'll not be able to reach the Tipping Point and then you know that doesn't matter like there are other Industries a lot of things you can do in life so you know you can explore them so if you're stuck here do some assignments what some videos I don't know what led me to have interest in this field or you know what leads to people being interested in CS but whatever that thing is try to find it and if not you know there are better Industries or you know other things to do in like next Point uh manifesting for Tech to go down one thing I'm seeing very commonly is you know people are really hoping for engineers jobs to get replaced uh even smart people like for example I have this cousin in SF and I had a call with him 3 days ago and he randomly asked Meir what what are your batchmates doing and I said half of them are in the US NSF working in some Fang half of them are here probably you know similar big Tech or some startup and as a respons herir bad things are happening you know all of their jobs one year gone I was like okay uh what makes you think that he gave me a long rant on you know AI is coming AI is coming agents are here every job will get replaced so on and so forth I was like cool uh then he started he was fanboying cursor a lot kir I met the cursor team and you know they so great and they've built a good product um I'm a big cursor fan I'm building I'm building everything using it I was like cool uh one experiment I just wanted to do with him I asked him okay do you mind sharing your screen and showing me how do you use cursor um I just want to see someone who's you know barely knows coding um how can they use cursor where do they get stuck do they get stuck can they build everything and he wouldn't share his screen um this happened for almost you know 15 minutes me trying to convince him he's my brother I don't know why he was so shy um but yeah he did not um and you know I think that's because this speculation he felt you know he was too intimidated to code in front of me um but I think the reason was if I today take a complete non- Tech person if I pull someone from the street you know or even like a marketing person or a sales person who's in a tech company and ask him by you're Cur try to do it at some point you'll get stuck this like very obvious you know as the project grows then you know AI hallucinates SL it can't help SL you know you have to get in there to fix things um and funny enough you know today he called me and he said I want to hire two Engineers for some he's raised a small check for like 120k he's building some agent thing I don't know um so he wanted to hire two Engineers for you know some $2,000 a month I was like to which he had a we response but H I think he still is a firm believer you know all jobs are going away which apparently might be the sentiment in SF or you know he's a little um young SL uh call it euphoric U but I don't know if if that is going to happen or you know if all of my batchmates are going to go out of job in the next one year I heavily doubt that'll happen um but let's say that does happen I me this is a thought experiment it's not part of the video um then I still think you know um what will the smart people do like if if a coder's job gets replaced then I think every other non manual job that doesn't require your hands um like a delivery guy's job won't get replaced but you everyone else's job will probably go away then um in that case I feel people will just build businesses like the world is filled with unoptimal you don't have to pay zato 40 rupees convenience charge someone should build another zato um and you know bring down the price to 20% 20 rupes or 10 rupes and you know squeeze margins U but that doesn't happen um all businesses are highly unoptimal why are we paying ews so much why why doesn't everyone get their own cloud and the answer is because businesses are busy making money they don't really care about costs you know that will keep on happening people will keep paying for value and that includes you know someone hiring an engineer um I could of course be wrong but I I have a strong belief you know Founders do need to hire inair which takes me to the next Point um if you are one of these Founders like my brother who feels like you know I will do everything or who's optimizing heavily on this one thing okay you know maybe now is the time for me to start up because because now I can code everything um most probably that's not going to work well for you U why because um as a Founder what you should really be focusing on is building your company SL business SL insights SL marketing and 10 different things um rather than trying to you know squeeze this the last penny here you know Engineers you know I'm going to use a tool to replace everyone um that is my personal thought as a Founder SL my founder friends uh delegation is sort of the most important thing so if you're a first time founder who's starting out thinking you know now everything can be coded so I'm going to start coding um probably is not the worst idea for you in the world for you to even hire like uh an intern for some 30k a month and you know learn coding parall SL you know see how he's debugging cursor if you know that's what you're using and you're like I'm I want to quote everything in CER that might be a better output for you rather than you know n I'm going to save every penny and you know spend aggressively on AI because this is a fancy thing to do right now it's a very fancy thing to do um but unfortunately is not at that stage where it can replace people um will that change as I said I don't know um but if it does change U being at the top of the food chain will help if you know Tech well if you're connected in this industry if you're working in a big Tech or a startup that's doing really well you're still in a better position than you know let's say I don't know data entry guy or a customer support guy um when it comes to you know providing value SL creating value in the future is what I think but personally I think it it's it is a long shot for you know every virtual job to get replaced next Point talked a little about this in this video but long story short don't use too much AI for coding I mean use AI as much as you want but make sure you're understanding what you're writing I I don't want to be that Uncle who's like you know PHP because you know PHP is OG language um if you think AI makes you faster and you know a good developer cre you should use it I'm just talking as an interviewer SL you know how people are interviewed during an interview unfortunately you're not allowed to use AI um because you know they want to judge you on your coding skills that's really bad in the end I have ai yes sure you you have ai in the end when you're coding yourself but during an interview they don't want to see that um they want to see how you differentiate from the crowd the lower you go the better by which I mean you know the if you know JavaScript then that's better than knowing just a cursor and making it code AS with you know JavaScript being a blackbox if you know assembly then that's slightly better than knowing JavaScript so on and so forth the lower in the stack that you go if you understand computer networks operating systems it will help you you know in the long run as an engineer U the person who's lower in the stack who's optimizing a lot for Speed a Trader SL you know whatever a Quant will probably do much better better SL you know get replaced in the end if that happens than someone who's you know using cursor to write everything or let's say you know only knows HTML CSS and JavaScript so on and so forth if everyone's job does get replaced the good thing is um we live in an amazing time right now um we did not have like cars or mobile phones back in 2008 it used to be a luxury um and everyone has like two phones right now um the cost of everything especially you know digital is going down cost of products will go down the good thing about tech is you can have a $10 product that scal to a billion dollars purely because you know you can sell it to anyone um so the good thing is if you feel like Tech is not a great industry SL everything is going down/ you know jobs will get doomed then you can be super complacent because life will be great eventually if AI does take all the jobs then you know Ubi will kick Ubi stands for Universal basic income government will step in you know the rich will pay for the poor or you know people who don't want to work hard and you will still have a great lifestyle um you can do whatever makes you feel comfortable that could be you know whatever scrolling on social media uh playing games the cost of everything will go down um though you could have a great lifestyle without having to do anything um and you know the government will will take care of everything else and you know you'll have some basic income to make sure your food and basic expenses are met um unfortunately we it's very hard to look back and there's a lot of you know comparison all around so there are lot of things you don't need for example you don't really need a Ferrari SL VIP tickets at a caran OA concert U these are all status symbols which I think people that are putting in the efforts are building businesses are becoming whatever create at their craft U deserve um but in the end these aren't really substantial things in life you can live a very decent life as long as your food and housing and family and these things are taken care of uh everything else is pure luxury that you don't really need so my point here is if you feel like chilling if you feel like this is a very bad industry and AI is going to come it's not the worst thing to take that betet just chill or you know whatever if you want to do something else do that but if you feel like every job is going to go away and you know um we're going to we don't need to do anything in the future then I think you have enough things to do today thanks to so many so much content generation and most of the content is free you don't have to pay for something sometimes for the best shows also you only have to pay 59 rupees um so that means good content will be available for cheap um and you can spend your day scrolling on it or you know SL playing games it's great this not not even a t it's like great U this is something I wasn't possible a few years ago um and you'll see your parents scrolling through social media because you know they're probably chilling now SL you know this is their time to relax up so you could just start doing that right now and the government SL you know the rich will will take care of everything else though that's doomsday prediction um if that happens great but if if you want to take my opinion I think if you can find the right Community even if coding goes away as a job U if you're in the right circles right there's someone building an AI who's coding there is someone building AGI right now um and all you have to do is you know get into those circles so if you want to train Tech basically try to get into these circles closer to these circles SL smart people it's not too hard to find them because there's a lot of crowd and you know not a lot of people who are at the top who are you know really good at their craft so try to get closer to those people as well I will say um with that I will end it I'll see you in the next one bye-bye

[Music] the future of work is changing fast from the way we will work to the jobs we will do only to the couriers that will [Music] remain the world economic Forum predicts that by 202 5 85 million jobs will disappear and a lot of it has to do with AI and automation AI can code now ai can write and AI can replace me even when I'm not there and you can't even tell so it's natural to fear that AI could take away your job too but the same report also predicts that 97 million new jobs will be created like an AI engineer who helps me create my AI Avatar hey Sai how's it going it's going good Lavina it's going good we're stepping into a new world a new territory and the question to ask is not whether your job will exist but will your job exist my name is Lavina Kut and here's the full disclosure [Music] I'm happy to be a part of Zero's media Network together zeroda and full disclosure plan to bring you well researched content on careers different Industries and the evolving job market of India let's break down the modern Workforce into four categories we'll call it the [Music] Matrix we'll start by drawing the x-axis and use it to represent the skill level and when I say skills I'm not just talking about degrees or certificates but also the real practical expertise you need to excel at something the more skilled you are the further ahead you will be of others one common misconception Young Folks carry is that skill would be the antidote to everything if I can just keep working on my skills I will always have a job what most of them fail to account for is the market you could be extremely skilled at your job but the market suddenly decides they don't need you then what quick plug I'll urge you to check out this full disclosure right after you finish watching this video because in it we have explained the market forces of supply and demand and how they can determine your worth as a candidate but these Market forces also decide how replaceable you are so on the Y AIS we will have what we can call replaceability which is basically the likeliness of advancements being able to automate your job the advancements could be technological mechanical or economical some jobs would require you to follow a recipe a cookbook if you you will where the instructions are very carefully and meticulously laid out for you to follow it wouldn't matter who cooks then cuz the directions are all there if you leave there will always be some other cook with basic skills ready to replace you but then someone also must have written this recipe book if one page of the recipe book goes missing who else can you call except for the chef so on the Y AIS we can plot the replaceability metric the more Irreplaceable you or your role is the higher up you would find yourself and when you plot out the graph it looks something like this the X and the Y AIS create four quadrants according to the skill level and replaceability quadrant one will have low skilled low replaceability jobs these are jobs that don't require High skill or technological knowhow they're also not easily replaceable by AI these are the blue colar jobs of our society this sector is like a sleeping giant this is because advancements in software are developed faster and implemented faster than advancements in heavy industry change is coming just way more slowly in Western countries especially there's increasing focus on automating these jobs but it's not coming soon enough in our country it's not a matter of if this sector will change but when it will change quadrant 1 folks are safe for now then we have quadrant 2 this sector has low skilled high replaceability jobs these jobs don't need a lot of KN how to execute and this is where we're seeing the first wave of modernization hit all the big Tech layoffs that are happening are happening from this quadrant also manual work like data entry or a cashier would fall into this quadrant one thing to note here is that when I put a cashier and a data analyst into the same quadrant I'm not saying they both have equal skill levels but within their domains respectively these roles require ire a more basic level of skills that said technology is also creating many new opportunities here for every dop that now may not be required always there is an AI expert helping me still create these videos for you the UPI revolution in India showed us that when technology is accessible and useful adoption can happen at lightning speed quadrant 3 is where most people need to begin to worry this sector has high skill high replaceability jobs these of the jobs AI is gunning for look at some numbers from 2024 meta's stock Rose 194% despite laying of 21,000 people Google hit record profits after cutting 12,000 jobs Microsoft reached a $3 trillion valuation while letting go of 10,000 employees this shows that in today's world corporate success does not necessarily equate to job creation and finally Quadrant 4 has our high skill low replaceability jobs these would be our Future's most coveted positions the future of work these are not your normal entry level jobs these are positions that require deep expertise and accountability something which cannot be expected from a machine even the best in these fields are not staying stagnant either they're constantly challenging themselves and evolving with time embracing any Innovation that makes their job easier unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you take the blue pill and nothing changes you stay comfortable keep working the way you always have hoping your job is not the one getting automated next take the red pill and you realize the world is changing you start seeing AI not as a threat but as a tool you learn how to work with it build with it stay ahead of it and those who do they don't just keep their jobs they run the future of work the choice is yours so what does this really mean for your career we've mapped out various jobs on this skill replaceability Matrix and your position on the graph decides your career's future viability look at software Engineers most people think all tech jobs are future proof but here's the reality the average software engineer is sitting in that dangerous Q3 Zone High skill but also highly replaceable why because because coding is quickly becoming more like following a recipe tools like GitHub co-pilot are already writing code faster than humans but the top 1% of software Engineers they're not just coders they're architecting entire systems and running large scale projects these are people who can look at a business problem and design Solutions leveraging AI to do the base work for them India's Journey from being the world's it backend to becoming an Innovation Hub is being led by these people we're not just service providers anymore today we have great Tech based product companies emerging from our cities companies like perplexity AI are reshaping how the AI space operates and pushing the boundaries of innovation what about the AIML engineers then they are comfortably sitting in Q4 High skill low replaceability for now it's ironic that the people building AI are the least likely to be replaced by AI it's because they were ahead of the curve the world is moving so fast that by the time a new person tries to start learning about new AI skills the goal poost has already shifted away from them but the ones who started early are able to keep pace and you need them to build anything and everything while on the other hand traditional Engineers the mechanical electrical electronic folks they are straddling the middle ground why because while AI can help design components and optimize systems someone still needs to understand the physical world these things operate in apart from Engineers we should also take a look at the Professional Services the doctors lawyers C and bankers doctors are firmly in Q4 and for good reason sure AI can diagnose common conditions but would you trust a machine to perform heart surgery the best doctors are not just treating symptoms instead they're combining their experience with Cutting Edge technology to push the boundaries of what is possible in medicine what about the others then they're in q42 but with a Twist the routine work which is basic contracts audits transactions all of that is getting automated but the top tier performers in these fields have no fear of AI replacing them because they are the ones making the Judgment calls no AI can make those calls because it cannot understand the human elements required in these fields instead they're now using AI agents to help manage their tasks and do more work than they were ever able to do before now with creative professionals it gets tricky they're in Q3 similar to most freshers in software and they are feeling the heat AI is already writing articles designing logos and editing videos it doesn't even matter if AI is doing all of this well what matters is that the market understands that it can replace you if you're a creative content creators are in a similar boat the average YouTuber or Instagram influencer is quite replaceable but today's top creators are not just producing content the top 1% are building communities starting movements and understanding Their audience on a deep personal level all of this cannot easily be done by just using technology and that is one Edge humans have over AI we also hope to be in the top 1% creators one day but here's the thing in every single field the top 1% Stand Out Among the rest they're not just better at their jobs they're Reinventing what their jobs mean they're combining skills in new ways leading Innovation building personal Brands and most importantly using technology as a multiplier rather than seeing it as a threat the future is not about doing a job it's about designing the system that does the job better and the faster one learns that the more Untouchable they become by doing this they are finally able to escape this Matrix most people think AI is coming to take jobs but the truth is that AI is coming to take tasks so what does this mean for your future what are the steps you can take to make your career f future proof the real question is not whether your job is safe it's whether you are ready for what is next it may be scary to think about but it's also the biggest opportunity we've ever had so here's what you should be taking away from this video one use technology to learn and grow AI has made access to resources a lot easier and has made new tools more intuitive than ever find those resources specific to your Niche and use them to help improve your workflows because although AI is getting increased amazingly better at its capability there's still a difference in output when it's used by a beginner versus an advanc and this is not something you need a degree for you just need curiosity and the willingness to experiment there are many tools like claw and Gemini to help you write deep seek and perplexity for research GitHub copilot to help you code and many image and video generation models like Sora that can help you create anything you want from scratch because in this new world the most successful people will not be the ones who know the most they'll be the ones who can learn the fastest today using technology people can turn their ideas into reality almost instantly just like U our sponsor for today U is an all-in-one business management software that's transforming how businesses operate with over 45 easy to ous

So are engineers able to earn money? In today's video, with the help of an interesting example we'll see that a Microsoft Engineer whose CTC is 51 LPA at the end of every month - how much money does he bring to the bank after paying taxes. So with a very interesting example, we analyse it in detail. The budget of 2025 has also been announced, so there had been some changes in taxes as well. And these changes seem favourable for the employees as well. So, let's see the exact picture that what is going to happen. So, there's a student - Kamala Gita Raman who recently joined Microsoft & got a CTC of 51 LPA. Now, let me tell its breakdown. Base salary is 15 lakhs, sign on bonus is 5 lakhs. Stocks are worth 35,000 USD which add up to 28 lakhs vested over 4 periods & every year it would vest 25%. So, in a year stocks worth 7 lakhs will be vested. And rest of the benefit of relocation is 3 lakhs. So total compensation of 1 year becomes 30 lakhs. Now this might seem a good number to hear. But now let's talk about taxes. Under the new regime we get to know, from lot of sources like Instagram, linkedIn - which are filled with information that - there would be no tax on 12 LPA salary. So, what will be its impact on 30 lakhs. Will there also be a benefit on 30 lakh from this new tax regime or only those people will benefit whose salary comes within 12 lakh? So, let's breakdown. So, let's assume that joining of Kamala Git Raman is on 1st April which is a new financial year. Now we're going to talk about the new tax regime according to which there is no tax applied on Rs 75,000. So, the tax would be applied only on Rs 29,25,000 which remains from 30 lakhs. Tax isn't applied on Rs 75,000 because our govt. is very kind & it believes that we spend Rs 75,000 on medicines, hospitals and rest of the things. So, tax won't be applied on this. Our tax slabs have been also revised in this new tax regime. So let's see what is the 1st tax slab. First slab is of 0-4 lakhs i.e. on the starting 4 lakhs of the salary 0% tax would be applied. Next slab is 4 lakhs -8 lakhs. That is on the next 4 lakhs, 5 % tax would be applied which is Rs 20,000. Next slab is 8 lakhs - 12 lakhs i.e on the next 4 lakhs a tax of 10% would be applied. which is 40,000. Now, let's stop here. We talked about 0 - 12 lakhs. Now, on 12 lakhs we can see that a tax of Rs 60,000 has been applied but on the news we saw that there won't be any tax whose salary is less than Rs 12 lakhs. So basically the tax would be applied according to the new tax slab. But the maximum tax of Rs 60,000 that has been formed can eb rebated - for whose salary is less than 12 lakhs. But whose salary is not more than Rs 12 lakhs they won't get this rebate. So it is as simple as this that tax has been applied. We aren't saying that tax isn't being applied but if your salary is less than Rs 12 lakhs, you can rebate it. This tax would be removed or you. For other whose salary is more than Rs 12 lakhs, this tax would be applied according to these tax slabs. So since, in this case Kamala Gita Raman's salary is a bit more than Rs 12 lakhs. Unfortunately, she would've to give tax according to these tax slabs. Let's continue our calculations. Next slab is 12 lakhs - 6 lakhs i.e on the next 4 lakhs tax of 15% would be levied which adds up to Rs 60,000. Next slab is 16 lakhs - 20 lakhs i.e on the next 4 lakhs 20% tax would be levied which adds up to Rs 80,000. Next is 20 lakhs - 24 lakhs i.e. on the next 4 lakhs, 25% tax would be levied which will be Rs 1 lakh & on more than Rs 24 lakhs, straight tax of 30% would be levied, which in our case adds up to Rs 1,57,500. So, total tax comes up to Rs 4, 57,500. Now before moving forward in the video, everywhere on internet people are saying - learn new technologies, follow new trends upskill yourself. And for this, they even buy many courses. But just by scrolling reels or watching Andrew Tate one doesn't get motivation to complete the course. If you're also in such situation, I've the right solution for you. Three 90 challenge by GeeksforGeeks has made a comeback in 2025 so that you can also make a comeback. And we took the resolution for the same in January, right! So in this challenge you need to select any of your favorite course & try to complete it. You've to complete 90% of the course in 90 days to get 90% fees back. 90% of your fees will be refunded & your father will be proud of you. Its not just about the refunds, its about maintaining consistency & finishing off which you've started. People start things but they can't finish it. So I hope this challenge will definitely help you in completing the course. GeeksforGeeks has already refunded more than 5 CR which means many of your friends have already participated in this contest and made a comeback. So, its time for you to select your favorite course as well. Follow it consistently for 90 days. I've given the link if this challenge in the description & enroll your favorite course. So this is just income tax on which 4% SES will also be applied - educational SES, which is sent for our educational institutes and that'll be Rs 18,220. So total reduction would be Rs 4,75,280. So Kamala Gita Raman got a CTC of 51 LPA which was actually of 30 LPA in a year. She gave around Rs 5 lakh on taxes. So, what remains is Rs 25 lakhs. Now in these 25 lakhs, stocks worth 7 lakhs won't be sent to the bank. So, now remains 18 lakhs. Divide these 18 lakhs by 12, so at the end of the day Kamala Gita Raman would get Rs 1.5 lakhs. Now, I haven't deducted any PF from it. After doing it, she'll get 1.3- 14. lakhs in total in the bank account. Now rest of the stocks would be there, at the time when she wants to sell these stocks. She'll also get that amount but it is vested after she completed working one year in the company. Now, last time some people were confused that when I deducted tax then, I applied the amount of the stocks when I talked about salary, I removed the amount of stocks. Basically, let me clearly say you. As lot of people are traders, last time they came with their insights on the video that according to the investment, your tax is deducted according to the long term investment. Simply, when you invest money, your tax is deducted according to the investment. But when you get the salary & these stocks are a part of your salary. The deduction there is different, it is treated like salary. Right! So, basically we aren't talking about gains - that how much increased & decreased. We're talking about that particular salary that in the current time, if a salary of 7 lakh is given then tax will be deducted in it. Okay! Some companies deduct these tax from the stock units, they reduce the stock units and some companies deduct from the cash which is given to you. It is as simple as that. Right! So, I hope you might've got some clarity. It'll be very complicated if I enter in its deep calculations. So, let's avoid that for now. So overall an employee who got a CTC of 51 LPA will get only around 1.3 lakh or maybe less than that (monthly) if they have done other deductions as well. So this is the final amount which Kamala Gita Raman would be getting & you can compare it with the old tax regime whose video I've already uploaded with Google's example. The tax slabs there're a bit different the tax formed there is different. You can go and check out the video. The link is in the description. I hope you would've got clarity about new tax regime as well and liked the video. If you do, then do give it a thumbs up & subscribe to the channel if you're new here. See you in the next video. Till then - Bye bye!

If you are a software engineer or aspire to become one, you must have heard of Amazon. Amazon is not just an e-commerce giant, but one of the world’s leading tech companies. At the beginning of 2024, Amazon’s hiring process was somewhat slow. However, by the end of the year, Amazon outpaced all other MAANG companies in terms of hiring, whether on-campus or off-campus. And as we enter the beginning of 2025, there are still openings for the SDE-1 profile on their portal. If you wish to join Amazon, now could be an ideal opportunity. In this video, we will conduct a detailed analysis based on Amazon’s hiring trends, the preparation you need to undertake, the company’s structure, work experience, work-life balance, and the compensation packages for various profiles. We will also explore the career trajectory once you join the company. Stay tuned, and don't forget to like the video before you begin watching. Let’s get started. One of Amazon's most prominent roles is SDE-1, Software Development Engineer 1, and many freshers enter the company in this role. In this position, the CTC (Cost to Company) is 48 LPA, which includes stock options over four years. We will break this down further. The annual compensation is approximately 28 LPA. Let’s go through the details: Amazon offers a base salary of 19.2 lakhs. The sign-on bonus for the first year is 6.5 lakhs, and for the second year, it’s 5 lakhs. The stock value is 15.5 lakhs, which vests over four years: 5% in the first year, 15% in the second year, 40% in the third year, and 40% in the fourth year. Additional benefits, such as relocation allowances, amount to 1.5 lakhs. The total compensation for one year is 28 lakhs. This role is perfect for those who enjoy coding. But what if you don’t like coding? Does Amazon have roles for you too? Yes, Amazon also hires freshers for the role of Business Analyst. Many B.Tech and MCA graduates join Amazon in this position. Coding skills are not a requirement here. Instead, strong analytical skills are essential. I’ve discussed this role in more detail in another video, where I cover various job profiles. I’ll provide the link in the "i" button and description for you to watch after this video, so you can learn how to prepare for this role. As a Business Analyst, you’ll receive a lower package compared to the SDE-1 role. The CTC in this position is 30 LPA, which includes stock options over four years. Let’s break it down: The base salary is 14,39,800. The sign-on bonus for the first and second years is 3,55,000 each. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) amount to 9,43,000, vested over four years. The relocation bonus is 1.5 lakhs. Therefore, the total compensation for one year is around 18.5 lakhs. Now let’s talk about the career progression at Amazon. Promotions are structured at Amazon. Here, your growth is based not only on experience but also on performance. Let’s take a look at the corporate ladder. You begin as an SDE-1, working on foundational projects. Typically, within 1.5 to 2 years, if your performance is strong, you get promoted to SDE-2, where you take on more complex problems and end-to-end ownership. The next level is SDE-3, where you design large-scale architectures and lead cross-team collaborations. From SDE-3, you have two tracks: either you continue as an individual contributor focusing on coding, or you become an engineering manager, overseeing and managing other people. In terms of salary hikes without promotions, Amazon offers competitive annual increments, typically ranging from 10% to 15%. When it comes to promotions, for example, when transitioning from SDE-1 to SDE-2 or SDE-2 to SDE-3, your base salary approximately doubles, and you also receive stock refreshes. I hope you are enjoying the video. But before we proceed, I want to share information about the Boss Coder Academy. If you aspire to work at a product-based company but are struggling to find time to prepare due to your busy schedule, Boss Coder is the perfect solution. The software engineering program at Boss Coder is designed specifically for working professionals. It offers a structured curriculum developed by industry experts, covering all essential topics. Additionally, you will receive one-on-one mentorship tailored to your individual career goals and knowledge level. This program includes development training, mock interviews, and resume-building sessions to boost your chances of being shortlisted. Since the program is meant for working professionals, classes are flexible, and you’ll also have access to recorded sessions. You’ll be part of a community of over 2,000 learners from similar backgrounds, many of whom have secured positions in top product-based companies. Don’t delay your upskilling journey—check out Boss Coder’s software engineering program through the link in the description. Let’s continue. Now that we’ve discussed salaries, let’s look at some of Amazon’s company perks. First, we’ll explore the infrastructure. Amazon’s offices provide a unique vibe. Along with state-of-the-art workstations, employees are provided dual monitors, ergonomic chairs, and many other facilities. It’s worth mentioning that Amazon’s largest campus in Hyderabad—the world’s largest Amazon campus—features relaxation zones, pantries, and wellness rooms. In the cafeteria, you’ll find a variety of healthy and tasty snack options. However, unlike Google, not everything is free. The snacks are subsidized at a very low rate. One interesting and unique initiative is Amazon’s “Dogs at Work” program, where employees can bring their dogs to work at certain office locations worldwide. Amazon also offers employees discounts on Amazon devices like Alexa, Kindle, and Fire TV. Prime membership benefits are available, and employees receive personalized gifts on special occasions such as work anniversaries, birthdays, or when they achieve something significant. Quarterly team trips and parties are also an enjoyable part of working at Amazon. When it comes to gadgets, Amazon provides the latest work laptops and high-end devices, ensuring that employees have the best tools to perform their work efficiently. Now let’s discuss Amazon’s wellness and fitness programs. Amazon’s wellness programs are impressive. Employees receive discounts and reimbursements for gym memberships, and wellness challenges and events are regularly organized to encourage an active lifestyle. Yoga and meditation sessions are also available at on-site wellness centers. For mental health support, Amazon offers confidential counseling services and mental health programs. Just like other companies, Amazon offers regular salary hikes, insurance, leaves, shuttle services, and many other perks. Now, let’s take a look at how Amazon employees have rated the company on Ambition Box. For Job security it got 3.8 out of 5,for Work life balance it got 3.9 out of 5, for Company's culture 4.2 out of 5, for Skill & Self-Growth 3.8 out of 5 and for Salary & Promotions it got 3.8 out of 5. If you’ve seen my previous videos about Google and TCS, you might notice that these ratings are somewhat lower. There are several factors that explain this difference. I heard from an Amazon VP that Amazon is a consumer-first company. This means that every decision made at Amazon is primarily focused on the consumer’s needs. You can think of it this way: in any discussion, the consumer always has a seat at the table. In contrast, companies like Google are employee-first, where employee well-being is given top priority. The reason for this distinction is simple: Amazon operates with very low profit margins and needs to scale quickly. It’s a fast-paced company, which contributes to its tough work culture. Additionally, there is the concept of PIP (Performance Improvement Plan). If an employee doesn’t perform well for several quarters, they are placed on PIP, and many employees leave the company as a result. This creates pressure to perform consistently well, making the work environment highly competitive. Because of this intense pressure, many employees feel that Amazon’s work-life balance can be challenging. However, one of the benefits of joining Amazon as a fresher is the recognition you gain from having Amazon on your resume. It opens doors to many opportunities at other companies because it shows that you’ve worked in a consumer-first environment, can handle pressure, and have the skills to thrive in challenging situations. Another important update is the implementation of the return-to-office policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees got accustomed to working from home, but now companies are gradually calling employees back to the office. Amazon has also implemented a 5-day work-from-office policy. This change has led to some negative feedback from employees, as many had grown accustomed to working from home. Returning to the office after getting used to remote work has been challenging for some, which explains the lower ratings. We’ve already discussed the salary, company perks, growth opportunities, and ratings, but it’s equally important to understand what Amazon actually does. While most of you know Amazon as an e-commerce platform, the company generates revenue from a variety of sources and workflows. Amazon is a global tech giant that offers Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the company’s most rapidly evolving products. In addition, Amazon provides digital streaming services through Amazon Prime and Amazon Music. The company also creates devices like Alexa, which operate on artificial intelligence. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in 1994 as an online bookstore, and it has since grown into one of the world’s largest tech companies. AWS, in particular, plays a significant role in Amazon's success. In fact, we use AWS to host our platforms and websites. Now, let’s take a look at Amazon’s global presence. Headquartered in Seattle, USA, Amazon employs over 1.6 million people worldwide in 2024. In India, Amazon has major operations with offices in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, and Gurgaon. Being a global company, Amazon offers extensive exposure. You get the opportunity to collaborate with teams from various countries, including China and the US. Many employees also transfer to the Seattle office after spending some time working in India. Every year, Amazon hires a significant number of freshers, and compared to companies like Microsoft and Google, Amazon's hiring tends to be higher. In 2023, the company experienced some slowdown due to the economic recession, but things began to pick up in 2024. As of 2025, hiring is still aggressive, and new job openings are available, so make sure to check them out. Now, let’s talk about how Amazon hires. First, let’s cover on-campus hiring. Initially, Amazon focused on tier-1 colleges like IIT, NSIT, DTU, and certain NITs. Because of their high demands and increased hiring, Amazon has started recruiting from tier-3 colleges as well. The hiring pattern has changed a bit. Initially, they used to hire both interns and full-time employees, but now their primary focus is to hire interns. In the final semester of the final year, Amazon offers 6-month internships, and based on these internships, they provide pre-placement offers and full-time job offers. This gives Amazon sufficient time to assess whether the intern is credible and suitable for a full-time role. After the layoffs caused by the economic slowdown, Amazon, like other tech giants, does not want to repeat the same mistake. They want to ensure they don’t hire people who may need to be fired later. Now, let's discuss the hiring process. It usually starts with an online assessment where you need to solve two DSA-based questions. Following that, there is a behavioral test, which focuses on how you handle conflicts, prioritize tasks, and manage stress or work under pressure. Amazon places a lot of value on an individual’s personality, which is evaluated based on their leadership principles. These principles are a key focus during Amazon’s interviews. After clearing the online round, you’ll have one or two technical interviews, each lasting about 45 minutes. These interviews typically consist of moderate-level DSA questions, mainly sourced from LeetCode’s medium or occasionally hard problems. There are two advantages of the campus hiring process. First, you're competing against a smaller pool of candidates, which makes it slightly easier to crack the interviews. Second, if you receive an offer through campus recruitment, the company has a strong relationship with the college, and they are unlikely to revoke your offer. This is because they want to maintain their connection with the college for future hiring and know that they will return next year to recruit top candidates from there. Now, let’s move on to the off-campus hiring process. The interview process is almost identical to the campus recruitment process: an online test, followed by technical interviews that assess your DSA knowledge and behavioral questions based on Amazon’s leadership principles. However, the competition here is more intense because you’ll be competing with all off-campus candidates. Since Amazon doesn’t visit many colleges, all off-campus candidates from across the country will be competing for the same role. Don't underestimate candidates from tier-3 colleges—there are some excellent coders from these colleges, including 6-star, 5-star, expert, and candidate master coders. Therefore, the competition becomes tougher, but the process remains the same. To apply, you can visit Amazon's career portal, where job postings for different roles and locations are frequently updated. You can also apply directly by using the job ID provided in the listings. If you want a referral, you can reach out to Amazon employees on LinkedIn. When asking for a referral, make sure to demonstrate your coding knowledge or share your track record of solving coding problems. Write a concise message explaining your skills and why you're a good fit for the role. Next, let’s discuss Amazon’s summer internship program. This internship lasts for 2 months, and the interview process is nearly identical to the on-campus and off-campus hiring processes. The difficulty level of the questions and interviews is also similar. Based on your performance, you’ll have the option to choose between a 2-month internship or a full-time offer. However, since Amazon does not offer full-time roles directly from the summer internship, you will have the option to choose a 6-month internship after the 2-month internship, which will lead to a full-time offer. Amazon also offers a program called “Amazon WoW” (Women of the World), specifically for female students. The details of this program are displayed on the screen, and you can pause the video to read more about it. Additionally, Amazon hires through coding competitions, one of which is Amazon Hackon. This hackathon is designed for pre-final and final-year students, where participants are given real-world problems to solve. Based on their performance, Amazon may offer full-time roles. The process is conducted through Unstop, and Amazon reaches out to the participants to incorporate them into the hiring process. The procedures for the 2-month and 6-month software development internships are similar to those for regular hiring. Another program offered by Amazon is the ML Summer School, which is specifically for data science students. Though not related to software development roles, the ML Summer School offers machine learning enthusiasts hands-on experience with ML concepts and practical applications. Students who join this program typically receive a 2-month internship opportunity as an applied scientist intern. The hiring process for this program follows a similar path to the software development roles. Now, let’s talk about Amazon’s exit process. Leaving Amazon is straightforward but can be both easy and difficult. It’s a simple process: you need to discuss your decision with your manager and send an official resignation email. Your manager might try to convince you to stay, but if you have a valid reason—such as a better opportunity or the desire to start something of your own—the process will go smoothly. You’ll need to serve a notice period of 30 days to hand over any pending work and documentation. If you are at the L6 level or higher, the notice period is extended to 60 days, as you will have more responsibilities that need to be transferred to other employees. On your last working day, all your company-provided gadgets will be collected, and your team may give you a farewell party. There is also a 6-month cooling-off period before you can rejoin Amazon, which means you cannot join the company again within 6 months. Unlike Google, where you can rejoin without an interview after a year, Amazon requires you to go through the full interview process again if you wish to reapply. That’s all about Amazon. I hope you found this video informative. If you liked it, please comment and let me know which company's analysis you'd like to see next.

How can software handle billions of payments without missing a single transaction? Today we're going to talk about the Uber engineers solution to. Billions and billions of payments. and easily explain how it all works. So let's go. Now we all know how Uber works. Click a button that pays adjusted money for a leaf from one place to another. Wait for your driver. Get in the car and arrive at your destination. Leave and then Uber pays the money the driver is owed. Pretty simple right? add 100 million users. Billions of rides and hundreds of billions worth of money being passed around later. And then our easy solution is no longer an easy solution. As Uber grew and grew in popularity, they would evolve their tech stack, going from a monolith application aka just one big application. They deployed to a microservice. One which is like thousands of applications all over the place. They'd switch to Postgres and MySQL. And just build technology everywhere around it. However, if there's one thing that you just can't mess up in your text hack, it's what's dealing with money. their system was messing up big time. first it was just beyond unstable. The system was fragmented and multiple different areas and services transactions were really, really slow. then reconciling transactions was just an absolute nightmare. Payment discrepancies and just major delays were everywhere. Imagine being an Uber driver, driving and giving rise for two days straight. Then a cyberattack happens and then all your payments that you've been expecting for the last few days, it's just gone. Nowhere to be seen, nowhere collected. So they rebuilt their payment system from scratch. First, they switched their system to a job order system. The job in this case represents the trip that you go on. Or an Uber Eats order. This job system allowed flexibility in having multiple orders assigned to the same job. So, for example, asking to stop at McDonald's before getting home. We've all been there. It's it's okay to admit it. Inside these orders are entries, which represents money moving from a payer to app. The sum always zero. No creating or destroying money. So if I paid $20 for an Uber ride, it would come up in two different items. trip fare, which is $18, and the service fee, which is $2. This then goes into the Uber drivers account and then Uber's account. Trip fare 18. Service fee $2. This essentially is how double entry accounting works. Credit and debit. I've covered so many different types of databases on my channel in the past, but none have specifically been designed to tailor towards the need of money or finance. So like, how would you even do that in the first place? A ledger. A line by line table of your transactions. Don't ask the crypto people what a ledger means. What makes ledger still popular to this day is that it's the only way to truly know where you're financially. If my bank account starts at $100 and ends at $1,000, but the purchases and depositors don't end in $1,000, well, some suss stuff is happening in my bank account. doing two seconds of research on this, I can see that, you know, Postgres or MySQL is clearly capable of doing something like this. So why isn't it suitable for finance? Well, first, most databases aren't immutable. if I wanted to change my name on any website, once I change it on the form, the database goes to the existing entry and then updates it, removing the previous value. This is because it is mutable. if I were to try this on an immutable database, it would have to create a brand new row with the new information and duplicate existing information. Then in the UI, I would have to grab the latest version of this. So obviously this is just not good and so wasteful. If you had a database of transactions and then they all equal to zero, and then some dingus deleted a row out of that database. you forever screwed up the integrity of your books. This transaction is just gone forever. So an immutable system would force an append only system, meaning that if a mistake happens, the correction is appended at the bottom of the database. Rather than deleting the record completely. For example, if I were to document a transaction, I could buy lunch for $10. That's -$10 from my account. However, the deli accidentally charged me $15. So am I. Can't you see -$15? Well, rather than just deleting the records and trying again, the deli has to refund me $5, which then turns into a credit on my account. You fix things by adding or subtracting to the end, not by replacing. popular open source options exist like IMDb, but at scale. Uber made the classic programing decision to make their own version from scratch, so they created ledger store. ledger store as an application layer that sits above existing technologies like NoSQL databases. It specifically adds three core concepts. Ceiling closes a time range of changes. This means that transactions that happened last month, you can look at and validate that they are correct, making them now read only. Uber specifically mentioned that they have 30 minute spans of seals. Manifest are files generated and the sealing process. This is a security measure to show that only ledger store can access seal transactions in the past. Just remember though, transactions are happening every second, so they use Apache Kafka, which helps the streaming of this data in real time to calculate and revisions. As for when, sometimes the data needs to be corrected in an already closed time range. Revision is like a table that shows the corrections that have happened while also making the previous additions Queryable. And leisure store. It was great. but Uber had a really, really big problem. You see, Leisure Store was built to be an opinionated about its underlying technology. So when they moved to their new internal database, they had to migrate over 250 billion records. And so they only had two options process all of this 300 terabyte of data in one go and then just dump it into their new database, or break down historical data into parts and process them individually and create checkpoints throughout. The issue with doing number one is that with such a big data, at any point that it goes wrong, you have to restart the entire process. Think about installing a software for a long time and then it just fails. On the last step. So they went with option two and here's how it worked. A worker boots up and reads the checkpoint of where the process needs to be started from. it then goes to cold storage where the data lives and processes this data and moves it to the new database, and then updates the checkpoint to say that the partition it filled out is successful so it doesn't get repeated. And it then stores this in a metadata database so that other simultaneous workers don't work on the same ones. And this process only allowed that data to take a couple of weeks and saved on a lot of money. have our historical data taken care of on a separate database. But how do we put this over live onto one of the busiest applications of all time? This is when Uber introduced the Shadow Rider. The Shadow Rider sits in between two databases, the current one and the one they wanted to migrate over to. The Shadow Rider pushes data to the main database as usual, synchronously, everything executed in order to keep things fast. The Shadow Rider pushes data to the new database asynchronously, meaning our system isn't dependent on if it saves right. The second. but here's another issue. What happens if the items fail? I'm. because it's asynchronous. We don't know if it's going to work or not work. To prevent this, they deployed a spot repair job to look at any issues and fix them on the spot. They also created a dual read and merge system. This reads both databases at the same time and compares the two requests. If the primary database had five records and the secondary had three, it would merge the objects together and say that to the secondary database and return to the user. This put the new database into production gradually to see how it handles under the pressure of a production system, but eventually that leap of faith was needed to be done. So they finally decided to commit to the new databases and made the switch. dock store being the primary and then Dynamo being the secondary. Gradually, less requests were being read from Dynamo and Doc Store continue to grow and grow. Oh, and thank God for that. But why all of this work? Just to change databases. When we talk about the ledger, we can think of it like a piece of paper. With each row dedicated to a new entry. I mean, makes sense for like 50 transactions. But what about trillions of transactions over billions of ledgers? Indexes. Now imagine this scenario. You walk into a movie store and you want a copy of the movie jaws. The cashier says, one moment and one by one, make sure that each movie in a gigantic pile of movies is jaws. I mean, you would be there forever. It's just stupid. An index in a database would be categorizing each movie by the first letter or by genre. So if I ask for jaws, you already know to look at aisle J, But in this case 26 I think 26 indexes are just not going to cut it. And this is why Uber has trillions of indexes that they have managed in their database systems. And there's different types. A strongly consistent indexes used to handle credit card authorization. When you use Uber, your credit card has a hold on it until the end of your trip. If the database isn't able to look up the whole fast, It risks charging you again and continuing this hold. Yikes. This is done with an intricate write and read process. First, ledger store preps the indexes that will be inserting a database record. Once it's prepped, it writes the record and if it's successful, will commit the indexes needed. They found that their indexes get stuck in the intent phase. So to counteract this, if they read that there's a record in the database, they commit the index. Or if it doesn't it rolls back the index. A lot goes into making this extremely reliable. eventual consistent indexes. As for parts of the application that doesn't require extreme precision. So these could be places like previous rides greens where waiting a little bit is fine as long as you get the end result. Think about a ledger for a second. One of the biggest key columns you could probably think of, if not the most important one, is date and time. Time range indexes does exactly that. is able to index within a certain time frame of ledger entries. When working with data, this is a great way to offload storage that is really old. In this case you can move data from hot storage. Think like OneDrive. You know easily accessible files all the way to cold storage, which is just, you know, really cheap storage that takes a while to get your files. So we now know that these types of indexes exist. Great. But how do we manage 2 trillion of them? After the index is created, it back fills itself with historical data. This is done in batches to save on data download speeds then is validated for completeness. This is done by using a checksum comparison on the data and then decommission this index so that the new index can get started and move along. the idea that so much technology goes into what we developers or even users take for granted is just absolutely insane. It just takes another level of engineering in order to figure all this stuff out. There's a lot of cloud services that exist that specialize in transitioning your database system over from one cloud provider or on premise to another cloud or on premise database. But at the scale of Uber, you have to figure out your own solutions, because what works for you isn't something that's going to work for everybody. Unless like you're left or something. A big shout out to the three engineers from the Uber engineering team that have written the articles that I've used to reference for this video. literally without that, I wouldn't be able to make this video. But also, I just think it's so cool that they can be vulnerable about the different processes they've tried failed and just, you know, done. What's the biggest transition you ever had to make?

[Music] I think they're going to fire me that's what brings me here I don't know what to do almost 80% of the general population suffer from impostor syndrome at some point in their lives it's the feeling that you're not good enough for your job your partner or just the little little things in life that maybe you've just stumbled upon these via blind luck and you could be exposed anytime anal is going through the same right now he's 24 years old and comes from a lowincome household in a small town his parents were overprotective and put a lot of pressure on him to perform academically his elder sister was academically gifted and frequently topped her class so unal always felt inadequate to make things worse his parents reported to blaming and shaming him they were regularly disrespectful to him instead of being understanding a typical case of tough love the result he achieved everything that was expected of him but is now crippling with self-doubt and what if they fire you why is that so bad you have a brilliant resume you worked at Microsoft and that can't hurt I don't think you get it if they fire me I won't be Microsoft employee I'll be an employee that Microsoft fired it's always going to be on my resume which company is going to hire me after that unmo is catastrophizing which means he's only thinking about the worst case scenario it's a trauma response where you try to prepare yourself for the worst possible outcome in all situations this happens subconsciously and usually the person has very little control over this behavior and it fuels their anxiety and why do you believe of all the people people you specifically will be fired cuz they're firing people left right and Center everyone's getting laid off and I don't think my manager likes me to begin with so there's that so what your firing would have nothing to do with you then right the market is in a downturn and some layoffs are expected honestly that being said you haven't even been fired yet so why are you worried that's the only possible outcome where is this fear coming from cuz as I can see you have performed well on your kpis I have but like I told you I just feel like I'm not good enough for this place everyone seems to know so much more than me has more experience and they can actually talk to clients much more efficiently can't even do that what unmo fears is not rooted in actual evidence his fear stems from an unresolved issue of low self-worth and I guess I should start by addressing exactly that first and why do you think you are not good enough okay I'll tell you what happened last week okay my manager came to me with a task list half the items on that task list I had no idea how to proceed with them that's kind of a proof right there the company is not counting on you to know everything already that's humanly impossible unmo even your manager probably doesn't know everything what the company is counting on is for you to figure it out you're in this position not to know everything but to figure things out and haven't you figured out a way till now you've done well academic L you're working at one of the biggest firms and how old are you what 24 so what makes you think you won't be able to figure it out again I don't know it just feels like nothing I do seems to work for my manager he's always critical he never appreciates my work and then he makes me feel like I'm burning resources instead of contributing to the team do you know for a fact that he thinks that or do you think that he thinks that I don't know the repeated use of the phrase I don't know indicates that he has not figured out definitively what he feels about this situation more often than not this uncertainty fuels anxiety further I guess he could just be trying to extract maximum value out of an employee or maybe he just thinks that I'm inadequate let me save you the trouble he doesn't think you're inadequate you know who thinks you're inadequate you yourself I don't even think he cares that much but you do and that that's why you think he cares and let's assume that he did have an opinion on you which isn't positive does it change anything does it change who you are but he's my manager of course I care if he thinks I'm inadequate if I'm not good enough cuz that could mean I'll be fired next this is your performance review right your manager gave you a 9 on 10 what does that tell you that maybe I lagged somewhere otherwise I would have gotten a 10 on 10 nobody gets a 10 on 10 unmo a 9 on 10 is the closest that you can get why you chasing Perfection to a fault expecting Perfection is good but depending on Perfection it does you no good before we move ahead I'd like to thank our sponsor for this video Odin School Odin school is an upskilling

secure your dream job they will also provide you with full placement assistance in terms of resume building interview preparation and a lot more I urge you to check out the course through Odin school's website by clicking the link in the description now back to the video okay let's do an exercise I want you to look around the room and notice all the white color objects done now tell me how many green color objects were there in the room do you remember you know what this tells you you believe what you want to focus on if you think you're not good enough enough you will focus on evidence that proves that you're not good enough but if you yourself believe that you are good enough you will look at all the metrics like your performance review your academic scores and all the parameters that are pointing to the direction that you are good enough I feel like they hired me by mistake is that so they went through how many rounds of interview to hire you six six rounds of interviews and they tested you across several parameters invested there SP time and money to hire you they haven't made a mistake and mo they trust you and you are here for a reason but you know what sadly you don't trust yourself you're listening to the wrong voice in your head you love working here don't you Microsoft would be anyone's dream job I do but not always what do you love about working here like whenever I'm able to do good work and I know my manager will see it and appreciate it makes me feel good I get the sense of fulfillment like I belong in the team mhm and when do you not like working here mostly days when I feel like I'm a misfit here like I told you a misfit how Misfit like like I don't feel part of a team also people don't talk to me a lot so I've started keeping away from them and don't you think that in turn convinces them that you're not part of the team that's why they' probably stopped initiating conversations with you could be maybe I I don't know I'll tell you the same thing again if you don't stop feeling unworthy yourself why will others look at you differently people treat you the way you treat yourself they learn to treat you based on how you're treating yourself so if you think you're unworthy why should they think any different and why is it that you attach all your self worth to your work you know your identity has a lot of layers right you're a son you're a brother you're a friend you're a partner to someone you are not just your work alone I know that but somehow I can't get myself to believe that it's all right but you know this imaginary Perfection you're chasing no one ever reaches there and you'll get exhausted trying to get to this imaginary place life will pass you by and you won't even realize you won't be able to look around and notice the beautiful trees and birds and all these beautiful things because you'll be so consumed in reaching somewhere but I really want to reach there I really want to prove myself prove yourself to whom to my parents maybe to my colleagues to my manager do you really need a third person to validate your self-worth can you not trust yourself that you are worthy they are not third persons in my life they're my parents they're my family I care what they think about me okay tell me something what did your parents say when you scored a 90% in your boards I don't remember exactly I guess they were happy but then they also said like I could have gotten a better score were you happy with that score I was but I guess they have a point I could have gotten a better score did you do anything to celebrate that score [Music] I don't think so I had my J means in the next month so I must have started preparing for that and you know you did good there as well right you joined Microsoft right after campus I did but some of my friends they got much better packages from right from campus some went to the us some are in Europe right now they're living wonderful lives and I just feel like I'm stuck here even my sister is doing much better than me I can see how proud my parents are of her and I just feel like a disappointment constant disappointment okay I want you to imagine your parents in this room close your eyes now imagine them saying we are proud of you son how does that make you feel feels good okay now keep your eyes closed and imagine your parents are saying we are disappointed in you you could have done better in life how does that feel not good not good can I open my eyes open your eyes are your parents here they're not suddenly you don't feel so good anymore right what happened it was you all along how do you mean that I mean that it was you telling yourself all those things all along it was you telling yourself that your parents are not proud of you it was you telling yourself that your manager feels your incompetent and it was you telling yourself that your friends don't find Value in you it was never them it was you all along and let me tell you something it's as easy to tell yourself the opposite as well that you are good enough because you are it's a fact period you need to stop questioning yourself and stop second guessing yourself but what if I'm genuinely not able to do a good job someday then it was just a bad day that's all it was a bad 24 hours and 24 hours do not make up the entirety of your life and let me tell you something more you don't even need your parents or your manager or your friends or your siblings for this exercise why give someone else the power to control your internal dialogue you need to be your own guide your voice needs to be your own guide your thoughts about yourself will always control how you feel about yourself yes your sister is doing great but so are you your friends are doing great but so are you I need you to tell yourself this every day that you are doing great make a note of everything that you have accomplished in your life and I'm not asking you to light yourself I'm telling you to tell yourself the truth you did so well in academics you bagged a job at Microsoft you are doing so well but what if I'm not at Microsoft tomorrow what if they do fire me well then you have a wonderful resume with which you can get another great role and that's a problem the future version of you has to deal with as in when that happens we'll come to it when it happens stop worrying about the future when it hasn't happened yet see everyone is dealt different cards in life and you will end up with different cards at the end of the game you'll win some and you lose some rounds but the idea is not just to win it's to enjoy life don't focus on the outcome focus on the journey but what if I lag behind in this journey still the same thoughts lag behind as compared to whom lag behind I I don't know do you think everyone's on the same Journey absolutely not they didn't start from where you started and they won't end up where you end up they're not you everybody's life and journey is different yes for this brief period of time you will come across some people who cross paths with you in life but their life path is different and your life's path is different but you need to start focusing on your uniqueness and your individuality that makes sense I guess and one last thing I need you to stop comparing yourself to these external markers they don't decide your selfworth you're not your job you're not your marks and you're not your performance rating you are you thank you

I have five side projects that will give you an unfair Advantage at getting a job it's not another to-do list app or some Netflix clone it's an actual product for real paying customers so here's the deal if you build one of these products I will be your first paying customer I'm also looking for a founding engineer at my new company so if you build one of these projects I'll automatically consider you for an engineering role at my company if you'd like building a real product for real customers carries way more weight than you know whatever School you went to I'll give you some rules later on but let's just get into the ideas idea number one give GitHub productivity vs code extension let's talk about what everyone is most embarrassed about their GitHub activity monitor the thing basically shows how much you've coded in the last year people use it as a badge of honor to show how much they code go off there's even a side project that went viral on Twitter called ship talkers where they would show your ratio of tweets to commits I.E you know how much you talk versus how much you actually ship now there's a dirty little secret about the GitHub activity monitor that nobody likes to talk about it's actually a horrible way of determining how much someone has actually coded in the last year and here's why if you click into this button to see what they actually count as a contribution you'll see they only include things that were not on a fork so they had to be in the main repo but then more importantly they only count commits to the main branch so if it has to be merged into main to count then if you just raw dog all of your commits directly to main then your GitHub activity monitor is going to look great but if you meticulously think out and plan a PR over the course of a week and then you squash and merge it at the the end of it you get one contribution so obviously this is a subar way of tracking how much people code because it kind of promotes poor software engineering practices it's really just tailored for those people on Twitter that are Indie hackers that want to brag about their GitHub activity monitor but it would be nice if we actually had a way of showing how much people actually code here's what the GitHub activity monitor code tracking vs code extension is going to do one it's going to make a new git repo for you called code tracking two every 30 minutes it will make a commit into that branch that just has a quick summary of what you worked on for the last 30 minutes and so now you have a meticulous log of everything you did over every day for the last year as well as a contribution for every 30 minute segment that you actually Cod it heads down You' actually be surprised how handy this will also come in when you're at a job and they ask you to present why you should get a promotion and you all of a sudden forget everything you worked on for the last year having a repo that basically says everything you did every day it's actually a really good way of doing that and lastly this has to be an open- source project because people have to trust what you're doing with the code and with the information so if you build this and it's closed that sounds cool but it doesn't qualify if you build this I will be your first paying customer and I will pay you $10 a month for this product now obviously it's not life-changing money but I'm also going to try to advertise this for you to help you get some more paying customers okay project number two semantic search of my chat history when's the last time you you thought like oh my friend texted me the address I completely forget what did he what was it oh man my brother texted me that Netflix login username and password like a year ago like what was it again you have to scroll all the way back through your chat history kind of guessing where to look or you're just kind of like guessing keywords and searching them in your chat history but you're never finding the thing you're looking for it's horrible experience we all know it now imagine you had a single app where you could just make a search with normal language and it would search your slack messages your WhatApp messages your Facebook messages and it could just provide you the information so it's not just keyword search it's it's actual semantic search using artificial intelligence now if you decide to build a website like this I'll give you a few tips on it but it's super important that you're very transparent with people's data and that you have a very secure process so it's a difficult notion to actually scrape all this data from different sources from the get-go can't just be thrown together in a night because the stakes are pretty high so it has to be open source and you have to think through how you're going to collect people's data and let customers decide which data they want to share with you which chat histories they want to share with you and which ones they don't one way of of getting this information is to just use a Chrome extension to kind of scrape whenever someone's on that website you make a ton of requests to basically download the whole back catalog that sounds like a terrible idea in my opinion there's a gdpr mechanism in WhatsApp at least I know that you can request all of your data as part of gdpr companies have to let you to request to download all of your data and if you do that you just get all your chat history so I think that's probably the better way to go but but you you're going to have to explore this yourself because these are incredibly encrypted messages and to end encrypted WhatsApp is extremely private if you basically download their entire chat history and then save it in a database not encrypted that makes it all kind of useless so I really recommend that you think through your encryption strategy here and I if I was a beginner I wouldn't try this one basically what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to get embeddings for each chunk of user conversation and then you'll want to store the encrypted version next to embeddings and then use just normal Rag and encryption on top of some kind of llm so the way that looks is get the whole back catalog put it in a database one of the columns in the database is the embeddings for that if you need to learn more about embeddings through tons of resources online so then when someone makes a query you take that query you turn it into an embedding you can use that embedding to check your vector database to see all of the embeddings that are similar to it you pull all of that into your prompt and then you just ask the AI this is called rag I'm not going to go into it much more than that but there are plenty of resources online to learn more about rag either way the llm is also going to get to users data so you also have to be thoughtful about making sure that the data is deidentified if you're just plugging it into open AI or something so make it open source so we can take a look at it now if you get this to work because it's difficult I'm willing to pay you $30 a month for this product and I think it's a cool product and I know other people would use it too so okay actually this is a good time to stop and talk about the rules so obviously I can't pay everybody $10 a month that builds this project cuz if a 100 people build it I'm paying thousands of dollars a month obviously I can't do that that's why I'm going to have a website where I keep a rating of all the best entries for these project ideas I'll pay for the one that's currently the best this should also give you additional exposure to anyone watching this in the future if they think they want that solution too they can easily find it and buy the product from you now the way I want to build this website is using hostinger so that I don't have to code anything hosting or sponsoring this video so they're actually the ones paying you I'm going to use the money they pay me to pay you when you're building a product having a landing page is essential it's usually common practice to build a landing page in a drag or drop website like hostinger and the reason reason is like they make it really effortless for you and non-technical people to change these websites that way if you have someone else on your team in the future that wants to help you sell this product and they want to make some copy changes to the website they don't have to bother you while you work on the actual product it's a good separation of concerns bear in mind this is not the same as your actual application right you're going to use hostinger for the landing page to make it look pretty and easy to change but you're going to obviously have to code your own application you can't use a drag and drop product for that you want to spend a ton of time coding your website not coding your landing page and that's why hosting or a features come in really handy with the AI website builder you can create a unique website in minutes by just answering a few questions literally it takes like four clicks and your live they even have additional AI tools like their AI writer to help you craft SEO friendly content the AI logo maker to design a high quality logo the AI heat map to predict visitor behavior and optimize your site every plan even comes with a free domain and SSL CT I mean you're going to need a domain either way if you're making a website and if you want a cheap easy and beautiful website for your project just grab the Black Friday deal and use the codee Jason 10 to get 10% off and if you get the 48-month pricing for an additional 80% off this deal runs until December 15th you want a landing page for this new indie hacker project you're putting together if it's one of mine or even if it's not I highly recommend checking out hostinger they're doing us a big favor by helping us actually pay you guys for these websites so I think that's really cool and uh so I like hostinger they're they're good partners okay number three this one's a little bit more fun and less high stakes it's called win my argument it's Thanksgiving dinner you're right you're in a conversation with your sister she's saying something you disagree with her and you just want to prove your point so you say study show X and she says I don't believe that what studies and so you think actually what studies so you go to Google and you search your opinion and uh you just get a bunch of Reddit threads or you go to perplexity and you search your opinion and it basically does a really good job of also scraping those same Reddit threads and you go okay what's the use of this I'm actually looking for studies if you can build an artificial intelligence that scrapes millions of abstracts of actual studies and then reference those to help you prove your point when you're trying to make an argument and then put that into a application probably on your phone where you can just quickly ask it questions and get actual information from real studies now the best way to do this is also going to be rag you want to consume all the abstracts of every major study and then reference them so if you go to something like arxiv.org this website has millions and millions of studies and you can just use the AI to reference them directly you might say is that illegal or something I mean Google indexes the abstracts the abstracts are just there I don't think there's anything wrong with referencing the abstracts I think if you try to download the actual studies I think there's going to be some issues but all you're basically doing is building a better search engine specifically for studies so I don't think it's a big deal people will say Jason you can use perplexity for this but honestly I've tried this and it just really does not work very well it actually does pull up Reddit threads most of the time so this one should be a bit easier lower Stakes but also millions of studies to think about and how am I going to store all that data and blah blah blah so if you get this to work and it actually does work I will pay $15 a month for this product so the next one is called AWS supporter Chrome extension or something name it whatever you want now the problem is I use AWS all the time and AWS is a mess it actually is the worst UI of any product I've ever seen in my life I don't think I've ever said about a company that company needs more product managers I think that about AWS everybody knows it it's a mess it's documentation often is is out of date the butt to click nobody knows here's what I would love to do I would love to have a Chrome extension that has artificial intelligence baked in it creates a chat window next to my a instance and I can ask it questions not only will it be able to reference the docs I mean that's easy like even perplexity could do that but I wanted to actually highlight the buttons and the step-by-step process I need in order to execute something I want to do so for example I say uh how do I change the TLs configuration on you know this server and it should be able to just show me okay first click this button first search that then do this then do that and it should highlight the buttons and it should explain it as it goes through so that one's going to be difficult because you're going to have to actually think about where are all the buttons and how does the UI look so it's going to be tough but if you can execute on this one I'm willing to pay you $40 a month and I actually think that this has the potential to be one of the best products on this list because nobody knows how to use AWS even if they pretend that they do uh they know how to do like a handful of things but no one knows how to do everything on ws and imagine you actually did know how to do everything that would really unlock a lot of potential so number five this one is actually really fun if someone can do this I'd love this one this one's more of a wish Robin Hood made buying stocks really cool and easy you just tap on your phone you swipe up and you bought some stock and people got really into buying stocks because they've done it well what do developers love buying and buy way too much of and love showing them off but can't show them off domains I would love a quick and easy place to search domains on my phone and even if I use GoDaddy or name chep or one of their apps or something not only are their apps terrible but it doesn't give me a way to show them off or resell them really it doesn't even give me a way to quickly and easily resell them I think if you get the entirety of tech Twitter on a beautifully designed Sleek app that makes buying domains look and feel a lot like Robin Hood I think you could actually get a market of people buying and selling domains quickly just like people buy crypto now the core of this project is just make a beautiful interface for buying domains through a mobile app like it it isn't a huge bet it's not rocket science people will use it and if you do this I will buy all my domains through you and I will also try to sell domains for you the most I've ever spent on a domain is $3,000 for reference so you can bake in your own margins based on that number six this is the best one Aura ring for dogs so your dog I'm just kidding could you imagine no no obviously don't do that if you do that though that'd be pretty cool but I don't think uh I wouldn't use it be kind of silly so if you do any one of these projects I genuinely think it'll give you an unfair Advantage because it gives you an actual product that you have an actual paying customer and I will also by making this website try to help you get more paying customers now I hope to do more videos like this in the future so if there are other business ideas that you would genuinely pay for a solution to shoot them over to me add them in the Discord and I'll do them in the next video subscribe and I I hope that you build some of these projects

2025 is one of the craziest years in the history some people are making more money than they should while some people are just struggling to make the ends made I mean look at the so-called cream of the country 38% of Ians didn't even get played last year and probably it's going to get worse over years one of the most demanding departments computer science is probably going to lose its Shin English is going to be the new coding language Amazon's web Serv CEO says it's possible that most of the developers are not going to code in the future some people are scared that AI will take over their jobs while some people have already given up we are at the beginning of a new world demanding new skills new ways of work and new Focus points and if you don't change anything about it I'm sorry because it's going to get worse see I don't want to scare you but the intro of this video actually depicts a possible scenario that we'll actually step into and in this video I'll talk about the research that I've done about the best skills and the domains that you need to focus on I'll also be talking about what are the skills that I am planning to learn for 2025 so this video is going to be very important so listen to me carefully talking about the structure of this video there are going to be five parts that I'll be talking about in no particular order see I want you to listen to me carefully because this is important stuff you need to listen understand and also think about this after you finish watching this video I'm not sure how long this video will be but it's going to be worth it so let's start with the first point the future will be driven by attention and people are brands with access to it will end up winning in the future you see most of the skills that we have right now like including building websites or whatever it is they'll get so easy that instead of having a team of 20 members you'll just end up having one or two Max the same goes with the marketing campaigns that the companies run if there are 100 people in the marketing department of a company right now it will probably be reduced to 10 or even five so the people dependency will come down task will take lesser time to get done and we'll have a lot of people who will get jbless in the traditional Fields because jobs are going to change we'll talk about this later the same goes with startups and companies the barrier to entry for businesses will come down by huge margin especially the ones who are solely dependent on online infrastructure and this is actually a good thing because more and more people will actually start their own startups instead of working somewhere so in conclusion how do you stand out and how does a normal student like you prepare for the changing future I'm sorry if this is getting a little more complex than rest of the videos that I make but sometimes you just have to come out of the typical College mindset or the J mindset that your teachers roll on you so coming back it all boils down to the access to trust attention and distribution that a company or a person has so my suggestion see it's not a rule you can completely ignore this but my suggestion would be to explore how can you start building distribution now it can be through anything it can be a YouTube channel where you're sharing your learning it can be an Instagram page it can be a Twitter account it can even be your LinkedIn profile the point is how many people know you and can trust you for a particular thing that they can actually spend their money on you this is going to be the future both for an individual and also for a company I mean just look at how many companies suddenly got so active on social media they now have full-fledged content teams or have multiple agencies to create content for them brands are literally paying lacks and lacks of rupees so these agencies just to create like Instagram wheels for them that's just in Z and man so this is my suggestion to most of you start learning how to write content how to research content how to State your opinions online and the more efficient way to build this online distribution is to probably end up making these videos because it doesn't matter if you're a student teacher engineer or even an entrepreneur making videos and building distribution is going to be the single best decision that you'll take in your life life now you might be like oh tun making videos is not for everyone no I don't agree to it like any other skill content writing content research speaking to the camera editing these videos choosing the right title and thumbnail for the video making those thumbnails and even doing the SEO for a video all these are skills and skills can be learned it'll take you somewhere between 8 months to one year to learn all the skills together but if you're going to concentrate on one specific skill it'll just take you three or 4 months to learn to a pro level see the demand for the skills is so high but the supply isn't much and this is is going to be the best time to learn all the skills because in the worst possible case you can at least make some side income while you're still a student but if it actually works out well then you'll end up making lacks and lacks of rupees for the small videos that you'll create for Brands so in conclusion start putting your feet into the world of Creator economy you'll thank yourself later and now let's talk about the elephant in the room AI a lot of people who talk about oh you should learn a and all this stuff they don't even know what they're talking about they are just copy pasting anything and everything but here's everything that you need to know in simple words like this entire AI thing it can be divided into three major parts based upon the impact that it has on people the first one is a very nich Market where there are AI ml experts trying to build new algorithms but the number of people here or let's say the jobs which are created here are like just limited to people who are in Tech and also companies require people who have years and years of experience in Tech Plus you also need to be good at so this is only limited to people who are really passionate to make an impact in like the world using Tech now the second one is a bit bigger market like where people take existing AI models or Technologies and try to fine tune it for individual cases or they try to integrate it with company's existing Tech now this part doesn't actually require you to have 10 years of experience in AI or ML and probably creates much better and also bigger job market I mean not just job market but also a better opportunity for startups or building companies you see I can also make a dedicated video on AI and all this stuff because this year I am planning to build or integrate some more AI Tools in my own you know existing workflow so just let me know in the comments below if you actually would be interested in it or not now before we talk about the third part of this entire AI thing if you're someone who's really passionate about software development data science and machine learning then I think you should definitely check out this platform called as scaler because unlike most of the other platforms the people who actually teach here are the ones who previously worked or are currently working at top tech companies so everything from learning a concept practicing that building real world projects to even preparing for interviews they help you with everything even the student Community is so strong that they help each other to maintain coding sticks of 365 days that's just insane and scaler says that over 93% of the students have been placed at top tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon and over 83% of their students were able to successfully transition their careers so even if you're a student who's serious about a career Tech or a working professional who's just planning to transition their career I believe scaler would be a great choice for you they also have the support of Emi options if you're planning to join any of their courses plus if you'd like to know more you can book a completely free live class by using the link in the description now this gets us to the third part of this entire AI thing and this is what most of the influencers talk about when they say you need to learn AI they don't mean either building AI models or building on the top of the existing models what they actually mean to say is learn different AI tools and try to integrate them in your existing workflow now to do this in the best possible way you also need to learn something called as prompting the way that you actually give commands context and instructions to an AI model I've link some of the best videos about prompting or prompt Engineering in the description below you can check them out later and if you need a list of AI tools that I use at my work office or even to make these videos here is the list now let's talk about the third one but one of the most important ones among this list let's go the future will be shaped by startups agencies and small businesses now some of these will be one person companies but most of these will be a small group of people coming together to build something on their own but even in the current scenario if you look at the surroundings around you most of the people who make a lot of money are usually the people who understand business and can execute things much faster than the competition basically where's the demand how do I increase the demand how do I increase the supply how do I sell what will be the pricing strategy how do I negotiate how to build a team and scale the team see all these things are even important right now but with the impact of AI with the ease of creating products and the infrastructure to sell them the next 10 years are going to be huge for entrepreneurship and people who understand business are going to win like crazy see just as an example even right now if you're running like a creative agency in India and if you have Indian based clients you get paid much lesser when compared to if you have clients in us the same goes with having companies as clients versus having individuals as clients it's simple logic but people just don't take the first step to do it and it's most probably because they're just scared to do it I've compiled some of the best videos about business in the document below so you can just click on it and watch them later see this is very important you can be a student Creator engineer or even a doctor having some kind of business knowledge is very very important and is going to be more important in the future the videos that I've compiled in the description below will take you almost 20 hours to finish them but will add a lot of value to your life so thank me thank me later thank me in the comments thank me everywhere be thankful let's go to the next one so now that we are done with the three domains let's talk about two core skills which are going to be very important because after this I'll be talking about the skills that I am planning to learn but again coming back the first core skill the ability to learn things faster because the world will move so fast in the coming future that only the people who can learn adapt and apply things at extremely faster rates will end up making a lot of money in the future but just remember this you get good at learning things by actually learning more and more things not by just reading how to learn things faster and that's exactly what we do in the mentorship program in the quantum project as well because we make people learn things so that they can learn other things much faster so now moving on did you ever think about like how much time do you spend on your phone every day or did you just think about how much time can you actually sit and work without getting distracted at all because there's a study conducted last year which said the attention span of human beings it came down by 50% in the last 8 years and it actually came down by 70% in fact more than 70% in the last 15 to 20 years and going forward this will get to Absolute worse so I believe the ability to sit and work for extended periods of time is going to be one of the core skills which is going to be very very important for humans so these are the list of five things that I want you to focus on this year but now let's talk about the things that I am planning to learn this year the first one is the scale of executing faster see most of the things that I do in my life are like just perfect but just I I take a lot of time to do them but this year I want to learn I want to master the skill of executing everything faster the second one is my English I need to get much better at it than whatever I'm right now I think I'm currently at like 5 on 10 or 6 on 10 but there's a lot of scope for improvement and probably I'll take one or two years to master it but yeah I'll also plan to make a video about it later the third thing is the use of AI see until now I did not use a lot of AI Tools in my workflow because until now they're not as good but I think finally we are at a place where these AI tools have become so so so good and I think I should definitely start using a lot more I Tools in my workflow and the last but not the least I need to focus on my food and uh Fitness uh I I've just completely ignored it last year but I think this year I have to take care of it so these are the four things that I'm planning to get good at this year so that is it I think I spoke about most of the things that I wanted to and also we have started behind the scenes channel to talk more about how do I make these videos how do I shoot how do I record how does a team edit that how do I edit them so all of those things you can find even this link in the description so with that being said I wish you all the best just let me know in the comments below about what are the skills that you are planning to learn this year I'll see you again I hope this video was useful kind of different than what we usually do but yeah anyways CH bye-bye see you let's go a [Music]

what if I told you that your coding skills could make you more money through a oneperson business than your full-time job as a software engineer I'm a software engineer and I recently started a one person business in the first month I made $111,000 all while working only 4 hours a day there is a specific framework that transform me from a regular programmer to running a profitable Tech business almost every programmer can start a successful business by following those three steps today I will show you the fastest way to start a oneperson business as a developer while other devs are fighting for jobs you're going to learn how to build your own money printing machine there are two types of devs in the market today they are the Grinders who work super hard at their job or if they don't have a job they work very hard on getting one they apply to hundreds of positions in the hope of getting those big Tech salaries and then there is the other type those who grind on using their coding skills to build assets that make their money online ideally that can even make their money while they sleep actually I don't have a problem with any of those paths I think they're both legit like the traditional path of getting a job or the more entrepreneurial path as long as you can provide for a family and you do something good that is useful to society it's all good to me the only problem is that in today's market relying on only one source of income so relying only on your job is very risky it's better if you have more than one source of income and alham for us as programmers we actually have a unique Advantage because we can build entire products from scratch we can automated TR anything we can use AI in a much more advanced way we can build products that scale and on top of this we can do all of that from our bedroom but the problem is that most programmers have no idea how to turn those skills into a profitable business you don't know how to monetize your skills before I learn how to code I actually tried a bunch of different side hustle starting from a teenager right I was first selling digital art for people then I launched my own online store to sell a customade t-shirts then I tried Drop Shipping like in an ethical way then I did like tutoring I started tutoring business and a variety of different things this was all before I learned how to code so when I got the coding skills it allowed me to find the more efficient path towards making money there are two main ways to make money with coding that gives you the highest returns one is the SAS you can build a SAS that's the dream path or you can provide a service you can start an agency like ideally an AI agency that's the smart path that's the one that I picked I started codebender AI it's an AI development agency that helps companies Implement AI Solutions we build automations and AI agents for companies the framework that I'm about to share with you has three stages but there is a hidden fourth stage that completely blew my mind like in my opinion this is how you can get to a million dollar per year or more so here's the framework to get you to start your business as fast as possible stage number one you need to define the niche the best Niche has a combination of these elements number one the people inside of the niche or Rich so they have money to spend they can pay you right you don't want to Target a niche that is broke because no one can pay for your services so that's number one they need to be rich or they need to have money to spend number two it should be easy for you to show return on investment for them so you want want a niche where those people those potential clients they have money to spend and once they spend money they spend like $5,000 on you you can easily show them that you can make $20,000 for them so things like automations typically a agents it's easy to show those types of things the next point is that they're easy to find you want targets like you want to Niche that you can easily identify and find online so that you can get clients right like if they're an amazing Niche but there's no way to get your first client like there's no point in going after them an example of a good Niche that is easy to find is doctors you can literally go on Google Maps you write doctor you're going to find all doctors is nearby in your CG you're going to get their emails their phone numbers and everything that you need to reach out to them that's an example of a niche that is easy to Target the next important thing is that they're in pain so there's something that is missing in their life there's something that is missing in their business where you can bring some value and the last part is that it fits your interest so ideally you're interested in whatever this Niche is doing whatever the businesses in the niche are doing so that you can do a better job in uh when you work for them versus if it's something that is completely boring for you it's going to be harder there is also a bonus step is if you have some prior experience in a certain field right like based on your past experience based on the network you have like something that gives you an extra Advantage you should also try to leverage that so the example of doctors is if you have a lot of doctors in your family you should try to leverage this right like if you want to go into that field because that gives you the first layer of network that is already done for you so the first clients could literally be either members of your family or they can introduce you to other doctors other people with whom you might work and provide like some some development service some examples of good niches are we already mentioned doctors but it's lawyers Realtors funded Tech startups so Tech startups that raise millions of dollars they have money and they fit into all those categories that we mentioned stage number two you have to Market yourself this is where most developers fail they build in silence so no one knows about them no one knows about their service and what they do they might be super skilled but if no one knows it they're not going to hire you they're not going to pay you so the first thing that you should do is use your personal Network go through the list of all the contacts that you have on LinkedIn who can you reach out to so there's two categories right like one of them is going to be like your target audience so people with whom you can work people who can hire you the next one is going to be people who can introduce you to other people so with the example of doctors that we mentioned right if you have doctors in your network ask them directly uh if they'll be interested in your service like if you want to build an AI voice agent for them for example like a phone phone receptionist ask them if they would be interested but then there might be another category in your network who they're not going to hire you directly but they know other people who might hire you so you want to reach out to them first this is the first layer is the first step that you do is easy to literally send a DM to everyone in your network that is relevant the next way to Market yourself is by making your skills public you want to show your skill set and the best way to do this is to build projects but we're not going to just build any projects right like a lot of people talk about building projects for job search Etc we're going to do it very very different the whole goal of our strategy is to leverage on an existing trending AI technology something that is trending big time right now so for example like open AI they released the real time API not too long ago real time API is this API that uh allows for voice interaction right so you can talk to it and the API will reply with voice this is something completely new that came out and there was a lot of noise about it imagine if you're one of the first people who build a project on it and then you post it on LinkedIn maybe you make a quick YouTube video like literally zero effort you make just a loom like a loom video where your face you you share your screen and you just walk through the project that you built this is going to give you a lot of attention because this new technology that has just come out there are no experts on it but there's a lot of people who are interested in it so they're going to share your stuff they're going to want to talk to you they'll want to ask you questions and that's how you can position yourself that's how you can stand out compared to the crowd that's honestly the two strategies I use to get to 10K a month one is the network and the other one is if you don't have the network is literally just find a training technology look into the AI news and make a project and post about it stage number three is the growth stage so once you have made your work public online or once you reached out to people and you have connections you're starting to have discussions you need to schedule calls right you need to schedule calls of qualified leads in out of those calls it can be like 15 minutes it can be 30 minutes maximum your goal is to figure out what their needs are what they're trying to achieve what their business looks like what are all the different operations happening there so that you have a good view of their business and what their need is and how important it is for them then at the end of that call you have to schedule another call for a few days later that call will be about the proposal that you're going to make for them and you'll try to sign them as a client for you in between those two CS you'll have a few days in those days you need to prepare a proposal so if they want you to build a chat boot you need to prepare like how the chat bot is going to look like how much time is going to be involved what is the feature set how you're going to build it that you can propose them a price and a concrete proposal and a contract that they can sign inside of the next call that's the strategy ideally you want to be smart about it as well that's why like in the first round like the discovery call when you ask them questions you also want to think long term like if today they ask you to build a chatbot try to think about their business and see okay is this just like a short onetime project or there's more opportunities because maybe the chatbot is Step number one maybe later they're going to need another automation maybe they're going to need an AI voice agent maybe they're going to need a bunch of different things so then you can build like a long-term relationship and you can start proposing them more and more things but the first step is to validate that first project they ask you we actually use this framework inside of my accelerator every month we have a challenge to build an AI app within a certain team with Andrew we build a social media AI voice agent that generates LinkedIn posts a client recently paid us $1,200 to access that tool then with Albert we build an AI voice agent and a client paid him $22,000 to spin up an agent like that for him and it took him only one week if you're interested in this and you want to learn how to build projects like that and land clients feel free to Boog a call there's a link in the description we're going to talk and we'll see if you're right fit for the Cod Bender accelerator I went through the three stages of the framework but remember I told you that there is a hidden fourth step the one that changes everything the one that will allow you to scale to a million dollars per year and way past that once you start getting clients you will notice that the work you do is pretty much repetitive because if you follow the framework correctly if if you identify the niche and you only take clients within that Niche it's going to be pretty much the same requests every single time for example if you work with lawyers and they ask you for some AI automation to speed up how they process documents every Law Firm will pretty much need the same thing right you just need to adapt a little bit from Law Firm to Law Firm but it's about the same so over time as you work on those projects you're going to start building some internal automations you're going to start building tools to help you deliver those projects faster clients are not going to know this so when you land a new client it will just be a matter of like clicking a button configuring something small and then you're going to spin up a full new automation for them clients they're not going to know this they don't need to know but that's how this is what is going to be happening internally in your business once you have that you essentially build a SAS internally and then you can make it public you will switch from agency mode to SAS mode this is way more scalable you can get a lot more clients and the exits for SAS are a lot more interesting if you sell your SAS business you can make millions and millions of dollars agencies are much harder to sell but the advantage of going this route so the to first building an air agency and then building a SAS versus only building a SAS is that with this approach you're going to take zero risks because clients will essentially pay you to build those projects and then for you to build those automations internally then you're going to get validation from the market because clients are going to give you instant feedback on the work that you're doing so you will know that it's valuable you're going to get very good testimonials for when you launch the SAS and you're going to get referrals from those clients that you have build good relationships with this is a much better spot to be in when you start your SAS compared to starting from zero and just spending month months of time building something when you have no clients and no traction instead of starting here you're going to start here with a huge strategic advantage of having all those clients those testimonials and that initial capital and this is my framework for the fastest way to build a oneperson business as a developer remember C Benders when you do the work others won't you will get the results they can't if you want me to help you like I said feel free to book a call there's a link in the description and we're just going to talk and see if you're right fit for the Cod Bender accelerator program and now if you want to learn the skills to help you build project like this check out this

It's above 1.3 crore. Now we know why there are no jobs in the market. He has taken all those jobs. I only have one job. Which other companies have you cracked recently? In the last six months, I’ve cracked eight companies. You’ve cracked so many companies! What was your strategy? How many companies rejected you? There must be at least 30-40 companies who rejected me. Google was one of the companies, Coinbase was one of the companies, and Uber was one of the companies. It’s not like if a small company rejects you, you can’t crack a big one. When you were in college, did AI exist at that time? AI wasn’t as advanced back then. Now it’s somewhat prominent, but not completely. If you give AI a challenging question on DSA, it won’t be able to solve it. If you give a good question to ChatGPT, they won’t be able to solve it either—100% guaranteed. So, our audience is really excited to learn about the roadmap to becoming a front-end engineer. But before that, let’s have a flash round. Basically, I’ll ask you a question, and you have to answer it in 1-2 sentences. Can a non-CSE graduate pursue front-end development? Yes, easily. If someone wants to become a full-stack or front-end developer, can they skip DSA? They can, but they shouldn’t. Personal projects or freelancing? I would say freelancing is better to start with. Should someone focus on one framework or master multiple frameworks? If someone wants to become a front-end developer, how much time would it take to learn everything? Welcome to the podcast, Vaibhav. Hello ,thank you, Fraz, for having me on this podcast. Vaibhav, can you give us a brief introduction for our audience? Yes, of course. Hello, everyone. My name is Vaibhav Mishra, and I am a graduate of 2022. I am currently working as a front-end engineer at ByteDance. Before this, I worked at Groww for almost three years, including my internship there, as a front-end engineer. Great. So, as a front-end engineer, which other companies have you cracked apart from ByteDance? Recently, in the last six months, I’ve cracked eight companies. Can you tell us about the CTC and the name of the companies? I’ll share the approximate names of the companies. The first company is CoinSwitch. The CTC there is between 40-45 Lakhs. SDE1? Yes, this was for the SDE1 role. The same goes for ShopFlo; the CTC was also between 40-45 Lakhs, and the role was SDE1. Okay. After this, there’s Atlassian. The package was good, around 55-60. However, the role was still SDE1. I cracked this around February or March. Okay. At that time, I decided to stick with SDE1 because SDE2 was more than three months away. Then, in June, I cracked Blinkit. Their yearly compensation is around 31 Lakhs. Okay. 31 is the base, and then they have some variables. After that, there’s UpStocks. Their CTC is approximately between 45-50 Lakhs. Then comes Zeta. Their yearly package is around 55-60 Lakhs. And then Intuit. Their yearly CTC is between 70-80 Lakhs. Finally, there’s ByteDance, which is above 1.3 Crores. Brother, it’s above 1.3 Crore. Now we understand why there are no jobs in the market. You’ve taken all the jobs. I’ve only taken one! Okay, okay. Thanks for sharing this; it’s making us feel a little FOMO. But you’ve cracked so many companies. What was your strategy for applying? How many rejections did you face? Tell us. Rejection? If I cracked eight companies, then there must have been at least 30-40 rejections after the interviews. I mean, I don’t know the exact count, but 20-30 rejections would be easy to estimate. Some companies rejected me even after multiple rounds. Google was one of the companies, Coinbase was one, and Uber was another. Getting rejected by big companies feels really bad. Even some startups and smaller companies rejected me. It’s not like if you’re rejected by a small company, you can’t crack a big one. Absolutely. Does Google open positions for front-end engineers? Yes, they have many positions, but they emphasize DSA. How many DSA rounds are there—five or more? If you’re applying for SDE or SWE roles, all the rounds are focused on DSA. I didn’t go through so many rounds, but as far as I know, they have 2-3 DSA rounds and one round specific to your role. If you’re applying for front-end, that round will test your front-end skills. Okay. When a student joins college, it’s very confusing. Should they focus on front-end, back-end, or AI? Should they study data analysis if they don’t like DSA? How did you decide to go into front-end? So before we continue with the podcast, let’s take a short break. I hope you’re enjoying the podcast. We’ve discussed many interesting topics so far, so stay tuned till the end. If you’re new to the channel, don’t forget to like the video and subscribe. Many students often ask when the next DSA batch will be live. So, the wait is over. We’re launching DSA 4.0, and it’s live now. The link is in the description. Go and register. The classes will start on January 1st. For those unfamiliar with our DSA batch, it’s a six-month course covering complete DSA. The first month is dedicated to programming fundamentals, including programming languages and basic logic building. You’ll have two options: C++ and Java. You can choose either language to attend the classes and continue the course. Both C++ and Java codes will be provided in the class. It’s a mix of live and recorded sessions. Most classes will be live, covering theory and solving problems. Extra questions will be assigned as homework, with solutions available in recorded videos. We also have live doubt sessions and TA support. If you’re stuck, you can message the TA for help. If the text solution isn’t clear, you can even video call them to resolve your queries. It’s an interesting course where we cover everything in detail with real-life examples and practice over 500 problems. We’ve received excellent feedback in the past. If any of our previous students are watching, please share your feedback in the comments to help others. You can also visit our website for testimonials. Let me introduce the instructors. I’ll be one of them, and the other instructor is Saksham, a software engineer at Microsoft with great teaching experience. If you want a class demo, the link is in the description. Check it out and decide. If you’re interested in learning DSA, this is a great option. Let’s continue with the podcast. In college, we used to attend workshops. Initially, we’d join one or two, do some front-end, back-end, or even Android development. Front-end projects were relatively simple and visually appealing. It was easy to show someone what you’d built, and I enjoyed that aspect. Working with Postman requests and getting successful responses didn’t feel as satisfying. But front-end development had a visual impact, which was exciting. I started with Android development, but my laptop couldn’t handle it. That’s when I switched to front-end, as it was easier and more interesting to me. So, I ended up in the front-end field. Great. When you were in college, was AI a thing back then? AI wasn’t very advanced during that time. Honestly, the atmosphere was good, and companies were actively hiring. AI wasn’t seen as a major concern. Now, there’s a bit of a shift, but it’s still not significant. Everyone thinks front-end engineers are at risk because of AI. In the next 5-10 years, I don’t see AI as a threat to front-end engineers. Beyond that, it’s hard to predict, but I doubt AI will fully replace us. While AI is helpful for basic tasks, it struggles with complex challenges. If you give it a tough DSA question, it won’t solve it. If you give it a challenging question on DSA, it won’t be able to solve it—100%. It’s still immature. If you provide it with a well-framed, advanced question, it won’t be able to handle it. By the way, AI is doing a lot of things, but you’re right. When it comes to some DSA questions, it struggles. In fact, if you write an essay with a human touch, you can tell whether ChatGPT wrote it or not. Yes, AI can handle basic tasks that are helpful to you. If you want to start a project or work on something complex like a BBS, you might need to relocate or change your environment, as handling such large-scale tasks can be challenging. However, I believe that ChatGPT won't be able to handle in upcoming years. Jobs, in my opinion, are safe for now. Do you think front-end is a secure career option at this time? As a front-end developer myself, I would say yes. It is a promising field with plenty of opportunities. I have an idea that Meta is there. When the company was doing it, I connected with seniors who were in front-end. They talked to them and went to new companies. Now I am seeing that seniors who are specific to front-end, those with 8–10 years of experience in front-end, are doing well. When they are doing it, I think we can also go to them and get an experience of 8–10 years in front-end. So, our audience is very excited to know the roadmap to becoming a front-end engineer. But before that, we have a flash round. Basically, I will ask you a question, and you have to answer it in 1–2 sentences. The first question is: Are certificates necessary or a waste? I don't think certificates are necessary now. No recruiter asks you to show certificates. Even if you show them, the person in front of you is not interested in that certificate. I haven’t felt the need for them yet. So, I don’t think certificates are important now. Can a non-CSE person break into front-end development? Yes, easily. I have seen people in my team who are not from a CSE background. They are from some other branch, and they are doing their job well. The most important thing is skills. If you have skills, you can do it. I don’t think your branch makes any difference. If someone wants to become a full-stack developer or a front-end developer, can they skip DSA? They can do it, but they shouldn’t. If you have three doors open, you can go through any one of them. If you don’t do DSA, you are closing one door for yourself. At the start of your career, you shouldn’t close doors. There are many people who want to enter through that door. So, it’s better to keep as many doors open as possible. But it’s not like if you don’t do DSA, you can’t become a front-end developer. It’s not like that. Are there any startups that don’t ask for DSA? Yes, there are a lot of companies that don’t ask for DSA. But if some do ask, then both DSA and front-end skills are important. Personal project vs freelancing? I’ll say go for freelancing first. If you get freelancing, it’s a good thing. But not everyone can get freelancing. In that case, you can go for a personal project. But freelancing should be your first choice. Should a person focus on one framework or master multiple frameworks? I guess if you are at the start of your career, you should focus on one framework and gain expertise in it. It takes a lot of time to gain expertise—it’s not something you can achieve in a month or two. Frameworks have a lot of depth. For now, focus on mastering one framework. One good thing about front-end is that the basics are almost the same as JavaScript. If you know JavaScript, then the framework doesn’t matter that much. Companies hire you for frameworks like Vue, even if you know React, because they know that JavaScript is the foundation. If you know JavaScript, you can switch from one framework to another. If someone doesn’t have an entry year in front-end, how much time will it take to learn the basics? I’d say if someone starts today and works consistently, three to four months are enough to cover the basics. During this time, you can learn your fundamentals, build two projects, and understand how things work. Once you complete this, you can apply for internships on many platforms. I’m not saying you’ll get an internship at a big company right away, but you’ll get something to start with. My first internship was also very small, and I used to earn ₹5,000–₹6,000 from it. How much you're earning monthly? Now, I earn this amount in 2 hours. You must have earning 5-6 lakhs per month, right? Yes, absolutely as my package is 1.3 Crore. What is the roadmap for becoming a front-end developer for beginners? First, start with HTML and CSS. Build a strong foundation because there aren’t too many things in HTML and CSS, so you can cover the basics quickly. Don’t skip anything because once you move to JavaScript, you won’t revisit HTML and CSS. After mastering HTML and CSS, focus on JavaScript, which is vast and requires a lot of time and effort. Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, pick a framework you like, such as React, Vue, or Angular. In my case, I chose React. Sometimes there is confusion about whether to study in-depth or start building projects early on. I recommend studying in-depth. If you know something in-depth, you can explain it to the interviewer confidently, and they will appreciate it. Good companies ask in-depth questions, so it’s better to take your time and build a strong understanding. Now, regarding the timeline, how much time should you give to each topic? It depends on the individual. Some might grasp HTML in a day, while others may take ten days. So, giving a timeline can be a bit problematic. However, you can set an upper bound for yourself—you don’t have to exceed that limit. For example, with JavaScript, I can’t give an upper bound. Suppose I say 10 days, or even 1 month; JavaScript can never be fully covered, not even in 2 years. That’s how vast it is. The key is to spend as much time as you need to feel confident before moving to the next step. Don’t listen to others who say HTML should be covered in half a day or 2 days. Take your time and learn at your own pace. Once you’ve given it time, it’s better to fully grasp the concepts rather than rushing through them. The next question is about the numerous resources available on the internet. You can learn from countless places, but does that make online courses valuable? Yes, because you’re learning from somewhere, and these courses provide a structure. You can teach yourself, but courses help you gain knowledge in an organized way. There are both free and paid courses. Assess your situation and decide accordingly. There are free resources like YouTube, online searches, Medium articles, and even platforms like Udemy that offer both free and paid courses. If you’re just starting, taking a course is highly beneficial. You need direction, and a course provides that by laying out what to study first, such as HTML, CSS, and then JavaScript. Without this structure, you might jump straight to React without covering the basics. That’s why courses are essential in the early stages of your career. Did I pay you to say this? No, not at all. So, did you take courses, or did you learn everything yourself? I took courses. How could I do it all by myself? Initially, I didn’t know what to study or where to begin. Courses provided me with that guidance. Now that I have experience, I know what to focus on, but when I was starting, courses were indispensable. In resumes, people often list clones like Twitter or Netflix.Do clone projects hold any value on a resume , or are they simply ignored? These days, if you have a good project, showcase that instead. If you don't have a better project, you'll have to show what you have. If you don’t have any other project, you’ll need to showcase this one. If you do have something good, then show it. However, this has become very common now. If you're looking for something different, try creating a small plugin, extension, or library. Try something unique like that. This would be a new and different approach. Since most people are making clones when they watch YouTube videos, doing something different could make your work stand out. Okay, what mistakes do beginners make when learning front-end? I feel that they tend to miss the basics. They think they can quickly jump to frameworks. For example, they may complete HTML and CSS in a week and then move straight to React. I feel like people often overlook the importance of thoroughly learning the basics before jumping into frameworks. Okay, let’s talk about resumes and portfolios. How should they be made? Is it beneficial to have a portfolio? Is it good to have an online website to showcase your projects? However, a resume is mandatory. A portfolio is optional, but a resume is mandatory. You can apply anywhere with your resume. It should include your best projects. A portfolio, however, provides an additional advantage. It gives you extra marks. For example, when my last company was hiring, we decided to consider the portfolios of candidates. Those with portfolios had clearly worked extra hard compared to others. While other resumes may be good, we gave extra marks to candidates with portfolios, as it showed they put in more effort. We shortlisted resumes in such a way that if the portfolio section was empty, we would not prioritize them. With 5000-6000 resumes to go through, we couldn’t look at all of them. Okay, let me ask you some questions. How do you feel about being in Dubai? It’s good. It’s still new to me, though. I haven’t spent much time here—it’s only been almost a month. Where have you been? I haven’t had the chance to explore much because I haven't got my salary yet. How expensive is it? It’s quite expensive. All the hotels are open, and the costs are high. As for now, company is covering all the expenses. How did you manage to secure an international offer? It was a strategy of simply applying to various companies. I didn’t specifically aim for an international offer. I was just applying. Regarding ByteDance, it was like this: ByteDance is banned in India, and TikTok is no longer accessible there. They have a center in China, but their main website was blocked. However, LinkedIn still works, and when I applied, it redirected me to ByteDance’s page. When I clicked on apply, it took me to the application page. There were some recruiters assigned to these openings, and I noticed them. I sent connection requests to these recruiters along with a template message. Fortunately, they were hiring in Dubai, and the recruiters responded. This helped me get noticed. Having the required skills is essential for securing an interview call, but getting the call itself is a big step. Fortunately, I got that call, and I went through 3-4 rounds of interviews. What are the differences between hiring in India and abroad? In my experience, the process is quite similar. The first round focused mainly on JavaScript and problem-solving. The second round assessed hands-on experience, where you need to demonstrate speed and provide detailed explanations. The third round involved system design questions. The hiring pattern in India is also similar, with a focus on JavaScript theory in the first round, followed by problem-solving tasks. The third round was React-focused, where you were expected to build something in an hour. The fourth round was system design. What’s your strategy for your resume? How do you reach out to recruiters? I maintain a list of companies, organizing them into tabs. For each company, I keep track of the hiring managers and recruiters. My first step is to reach out to recruiters. For instance, if I want to contact a Walmart recruiter, I go to their LinkedIn profile. I use the Apollo.io extension, which gives me unlimited email access, including work emails. I save these emails in a Google Sheet. I created a NodeMailer. I made a NodeMailer to automate the process. I would take the name from a GoogleSheet, and then send it to my Gmail account. To do this, I needed to share my Google credentials. Once that’s set up, I can send the emails. I collected 5-6 emails in total. I made sure I had a collection of emails. I would then try sending emails Monday mornings. I repeated this every Monday morning. This timing was beneficial because people usually log in to their emails on Mondays. I used to send a lot of emails. In fact, I used to mail 100-200 people at a time. I was using a script, I also manually handled certain parts. It's not like I relied solely on the script. There were times when I had to write specific emails for different people, and I couldn’t use the same script for everyone. So, I added some manual effort into it. For example, when I had an interview with Uber, I emailed them 17-18 times on the same thread, saying things like, “I’m still waiting for your response.” Did you get a response? Yes, after 18 hours, I finally heard back. It had been quite a long wait, but I knew they were hiring someone. They didn’t say “thank you for joining Uber as a front-end developer” or any other formal acknowledgment. I figured out that they were at least reviewing my front-end experience, even though they were hiring others but not me. Yes, I kept sending emails. Finally, they responded. You have to stay very active in your job search. I had a lot of time to apply, so I made sure to keep applying. How much time did you dedicate? I used to give 1-2 hours every day to apply for jobs. I would send the emails in the morning before starting my office work. Did you set up a bot for this? No, I didn’t set up a bot. Instead, I had to wake up at 10 am and start the script manually. The reason is that you can’t send all the emails in just 10 seconds, or Google will ban your account. There used to be a time when you could send emails with an interval of 90-620 seconds. Give me the script for it. So that our people can use this script, please share it along with your resume if possible. Just remember to hide any personal details. It will be very helpful. Now, the emails you were sending, did they include your resume? Yes, of course. And one more thing, I used to keep my resume as a link. I didn’t attach it directly. This way, I didn't need to attach any documents. It may seem like it only saved 10-15 seconds, but over 100 emails, that’s a huge time saver—around 1500 seconds. This is how an engineer thinks. Nice strategy. I hadn’t even considered that. Though I’m not applying this myself, it’s a very good strategy. If you're not active during that time, at least you’re making the best of it. By the way, as you said, you need to run the script. There's a solution for that too. You can host this script and put a timer on it, rather than using a pub/sub job. For example, you can set the job to trigger at 9 AM and the script will run automatically. But I think you’d need an internet connection for that. You could host it on the cloud, but it will cost some money. Yes, that’s true. But at 10 AM, I’d just need to click and press enter. I wouldn't have to do anything else. Nice. How is your day typically spent working here in Dubai? These days, I’m working in the office here in Dubai. It’s a little different from India, though. The work culture here is very strict. It's 9 AM, and I’m heading to the office at 9:30 because it’s my first week. The office is already full by then. It’s not like in India where there might still be a few empty seats. Everyone is in the office at 9:30 AM. Another difference is that no one talks much here like they only talk in meetings. If they need to discuss something, they go to a meeting. It’s not like in India where there’s a lot of chit-chat. Chinese companies are generally more professional. Their working schedule is much tougher than in India and Dubai, so the employees are happy with this schedule. How many hours do you work here? It’s from 9 AM to 6 PM here, with a 1-hour lunch break. But some people don’t even take a full hour for lunch. After eating, they go back to work. They are very disciplined here. You must be interested in playing table tennis, right? I’m actually a big fan of football. I used to play a lot in my old office. Whenever you had a break, you’d play football. Isn’t it available here? No, not here. Maybe when more Indians come, they’ll bring some of their culture with them, like football. What about the differences in salary packages? Considering the level you’re at now, you have a 1.3 crore package. If you had been in India at the same level, how much would you have been offered at any company? In India, I think, right now, a good company would give you a base salary of around 30-40 lakhs. For a product-based company, if you’re coming as an SDE2, they’ll offer you a base salary of 26-30 lakhs. It can range up to 35-40 lakhs or even more if you have offers from other companies. Can you go up to 50 lakhs? You can even reach 55 lakhs. I saw a Leet code compensation for someone at Zepto, and their base salary was 55 lakhs with 2.5 to 3 years of experience. They had a competing offer and attached it, so Zepto raised the offer to 55 lakhs. If you have multiple offers, you can negotiate for higher salaries, but you need to have both offers and the right skills to achieve this. Let's add some calculations to understand the package better. You have a 1.3 crore package. Considering living expenses here, your yearly expenses will be around 24-30 lakhs. So, after expenses, you’ll have around 1 crore remaining. You don’t need to pay taxes on that 1 crore income. We’ll pay tax this year, but not next year. Once your residency status changes, you won’t be taxed in India anymore. If you’re earning 50 lakhs in India, and living in a place like Bangalore, 12-13 lakhs would go towards expenses in a year. So, after taxes, you’ll have around 38 lakhs remaining, and from that, you’ll pay around 30% tax. After taxes, you’ll be left with 35 lakhs, out of which 12 lakhs will go towards living expenses. So, you’ll be left with around 23-25 lakhs. There’s a big difference, which is why you came here. Okay, I wanted to know if there’s a saturation point where your 1.3 crore salary reaches its limit. What is the maximum salary for a front-end developer? I don’t have much of an idea about the exact number. I don’t think of front-end developers any differently from other software engineers. I’ve applied to so many companies that I don’t even think front-end developers are paid less. They get paid the same. It’s a myth that front-end developers earn less. Companies hiring front-end developers are paying competitively, just like other roles. So the software engineer that is earning after 10 years, frontend engineer will also earn the same? What is the maximum package you have heard of for a software engineer? The maximum salary of a software engineer can vary, but typically, VPs in India earn between 1.5 to 2 crore per year. You’ve heard less? I’m not sure if MNC VPs have higher salaries. But from what I’ve heard, some VPs can earn up to 10 crore. The software engineering field offers a lot of money, but there are fewer higher-level jobs. And fewer people reach those positions. Rapid fire round? Yes! React, Angular, or Vue? React, any day. Toughest language to master? JavaScript. First framework you learned? React. Any other frameworks? React is a library, not a framework. One thing you hate about front-end development? Animations. Too many animations. While animations can feel good, too many of them can overwhelm the user experience. What’s the saying? Designer’s dream is a front-end engineer’s nightmare. It’s accurate, because too many animations can make things complicated. A company you’d like to work for? Meta. They created React, which is one of the reasons I admire them. Also, they are a great MNC. Would you share or subscribe to Fraz’s channel? Both! Let’s wrap up. Any advice for developers entering front-end or those already in the field who want to switch? For those just starting, keep your basics clear. Don’t rush into things. Practice some DSA, but not the hardcore stuff. It’s better to understand the basics, like array and string questions. When I was transitioning, I was asked about problem-solving methods based on arrays and strings, even if I wasn’t doing hardcore DSA. Don’t get scared when you see DSA-style problems. It’s really about basic problem solving. You won’t need advanced data structures like graphs, but you should understand basic concepts such as sliding window, two pointers, and operations on arrays and strings. These are commonly asked because they are useful in daily problem solving. Let’s wrap up. Like the video, subscribe to the channel, and you can follow Vaibhav on LinkedIn. I’ll provide the link and ID in the description. All the resources we’ve discussed will also be available in the description and telegram group. You can join the group to get more updates. Thank you so much for watching. See you in the next episode. Thank you, Vaibhav. Thank you.

High ping Technologies I'm learning in 2025 um disclaimer before we start these are just my experiences and the circle that I talk to the people that I'm interacting with that lead to me thinking that these are hyping Technologies in 2025 it may or may not be that if you are someone who's currently stuck in a job doing you know let's say standard development you're doing espet PHP man python whatever um if you feel like you've hit a ceiling if if you feel like you're not learning anything new every day these are the technologies that I spending my time on um you can choose to at least explore them from the sides dive deeper into it based on you know how much time do you have but if I had the full year free let's say for example I would spend my time learning these Technologies for one to two months and the ones that I really liked the ones in which I could clearly see a market growing or a company that I would could get a job in um I would spend most of my time learning that technology the reason to learn these Technologies is fairly simple um you can either get a extremely high paying you know 100K remote offer if you know a technology if you either know the breadth of technology that means once you join you're handling everything um that includes front end backend devops monitoring things go down production issues cicd U that is one way you can get there in the second path it's easier to convince a company it's easier for you to show proof of work it's easier for you to negotiate um which is why if you've been given a choice of learning let's say something like d Jango versus learning something like core deep Tech video processing um it's a good idea to go for the second one if you can clearly see a company or a market that's growing very quickly so we'll talk about some of these markets that you can think of that are slightly more than just basic web development or app development um that you may choose to spend your time on where do I figure out these Technologies or companies U it's mostly my circle talking to friends who are in SF following funding announcements following what kind of companies are currently getting funded in YC and then figuring out what's their Tech stack and what an engineer there might be working on on a day-to-day basis with that a very small disclaimer this might not be an extremely beginner friendly video If you haven't coded at all until this point might be a good idea to pay your debts do the standard DSA Dev grind for a few months before you come back to this video and you know try to Target one of these Technologies let's get right into it number one is going to be agents um it's the hot word in town right now if you talk to anyone in SF half of them are building agent startups um what is an agent um basically an llm is the simplest you know 10x outcome that's come out of ml right now which is give it some text it responds back with some text that is great uh but that's not where we want to reach um where do we want to reach that's AI U artificial general intelligence where you don't have to do anything we as humans can simply sit on the side and it'll keep on working and you know make decisions that us humans have to take right now agents are somewhere in the middle U they do require some level of human intervention but at the same time they're trying to achieve a few things that you would expect from an AGI their LMS sort of talking to themselves um think of them as um a bunch of LM M calls that happen one after the other and there are some level of decision making that you know is happening through the llm think of an agent has a bunch of llm calls that happen one after the other that help it make some decisions um and this agent is sort of connected to real world applications things like your Gmail WhatsApp U so that it can send you messages notifications um it can call a phone number it can sign into a website so on and so forth um I'll give a few examples of what these companies look like and you know what's expected once you join um for example um if you ever want to build a system that let's say U talks to your customers and tries to upsell them on something and at some point U needs human intervention to create a coupon code and you know tries to negotiate with a user an end user of yours U to sell something specific U that's a good example of a workflow that you can create um using a platform like this um when you create an agent there are 10 different things that could go right could go wrong um and hence if you look at the YC list of companies in this patch and the last one there are a lot of companies surrounding agents um how do you make agents safe how do you give agents access to money how do you give agents access to your authentication your Gmail U how do you make agents secure how do you make agents talk to U humans in the middle these are sort of very auxiliary companies that are getting built out which are sort of signs this might be big in the future or this is something that VCS are betting on to be big in the future why is that the case U I think as I said until we reach AGI we'll sort of have to compromise with agents um there are Middle Ground between pure llm calls and something like a which God knows how far it is again what is an agent a good example of this is a voice agent um if you ever receive a call from dominoes to do a reservation or a booking that's a good example of you know an agent that you're talking to it's not a human on the other side um it's an agent or a voice agent that can talk to you understand what you're saying and talk to a database figure out what times are currently available for that restaurant and you know book the restaurant for you these are real world use cases of systems like these um fairly hot market right now I think chat Bots and voice agents are the initial set of things that you can think of doing but now agents are going into a very weird direction of um you know building very weird use cases we'll talk about some of them um in the next point but agent as a jargon Frameworks that I used to create agents agent marketplaces and products buil built around agents is something I would spend my time on it's nothing too complicated it's a layer on top of llms uh which is why as a full stack engineer it's not too hard for you to dive into one of these with that we'll move to the next one which is a very specific use case of call them agents or you know General ml/ llms um which is browser automation since um llms have been a thing I found a few very specific companies that solve problems that require a lot of browser automation I'll take a few examples um induced AI is a company that initially got funded for creating uh an AI that can control a browser a similar example is I just found one which was browser use U it's open source I think it's part of this or the last YC batch um that's one set of companies where you need to remotely control a browser you need to give um an AI access to a browser and let it navigate to various websites talk to an llm and understand what the user wants from the AI a good example is I can talk to the AI and tell it to book um a flight for me from Delhi to mumbay it's very futuristic U and you know that's why a lot of these companies that raised to build this are now pivoting to something else um but another good example of browser automation is something I talked about in my recent life which is a meeting bot that can join um a Google meet or a zoom meeting and record the the whole thing transcribe the whole thing figure out the action items and create a a nice dock out of these and email it to all the participants this and you know many other use cases would involve you controlling a browser remotely so this very Niche skill U of getting really good at controlling browsers via selenium or playright or you know any other tool that you might have used to start browsers U is a very Niche skill that if you can Master U then you can solve a paino for one of these companies even though this is not too hard to do um I think as you scale this if you have a not a million but let's say a few thousand browser instances running on the cloud that's a hard problem to scale U so how would you do that how would you start browsers what if a browser crashes how do you restarted how do you make sure there is some level of reliability um is one thing that would be important to these companies so I already know this so I'm not really spending my time on this uh but if I was you and if I hadn't spent time here remote browser controll tools U and in the worst case uh this will help you write good integration tests u in the best case you know you might be able to use this knowledge in a specific AI company with that we'll move to the third point and I do apologize I think a lot of these are very AI related but unfortunately most of the funding is currently in this market so it's just easier to find companies who over raised recently and are currently you know hiring aggressively for a problem um so the problem most probably is going to be you know in some form of fashion related to AI the next one is making well just understanding the code base of vs code honestly um vs code is a fairly large code base I think it has some more than 100K comits um and a lot of folks are coming out the most successful one being cursor um I think cursor has proven a very decent business model from what I remember there at 50 mil AR have raised at a $2.5 billion valuation and not a lot of people around the world understand the code base of vs code completely and to build a company like uh cursor eventually they'll probably spin this out and you know build the editor from scratch or hire a bunch of vs code people work with Microsoft that's my guess right now um so knowing how VSS code is written understanding how you can create extensions let's say tabs uh you know building a visual UI inside Visual Studio code um would be a decent skill to know um reason being there's just a lot of folks coming out a wind surface another one that came out by the folks at codium they're also valid at a billion dollars um so believe it or not um either get really good at vs code and understanding its code base or um a few other markets are um all of these coding extensions sort of require them to work with not just vs code but let's say t or neovim if you are really good at a specific text editor or making extensions in text editors U you can be the go-to guy or you the goto company for for Port in these AI extensions from vs Cod to neovim let's say um that might be another Vector I would take in these companies and the next part here is indexing code bases as well I think the reason that cursor works so well is not just that have a they have a fancier UI compared to vs code but because they understand your codebase really well U that involves a bunch of you know AI plus non- a challenges how are you um indexing the users code base how are you making sure with a limited context window um you can send the right information to llms how can you make sure you're sending it faster how you're making sure the response that's coming back is passed correctly so on and so forth um this knowledge can be used in a product not just like uh codium or U cursor you can also use this knowledge to build something like Devin or dosu bot if you have heard of it which was one of the initial you know GitHub PR Bots that would automatically try to solve your issues it's similar to Deon but it doesn't have a fancy UI um it was just a a direct PR integration Bard that you would integrate with your codebase and it would start to either solve PRS or comment on PRS at the very least point the developers in the right directions so on and so forth so this specific Market basically you know developer productivity Market making developers faster replacing developers is now a very growing Market there are more tools to help developers code than you know developers that are coding that's of course not true um but at this point it feels um one of the very big competing metrics amongst openi and you know Google is who's built a better coder um so you'll see this sort of happening for a while for that reason um there'll be a lot of funding in this market though one of these companies even though you know I'm sure they're all plate to some point they're all saturate and eventually they'll be one or two winners but until then there'll be a lot of funding so getting into one of these companies one you can learn a lot to you'll be in the center of the action you know building for developers building to replace developers and of course uh even if this doesn't work out uh you'll have enough knowledge about talking to llms paring the response which can be used in other use cases as well so that' be the third one um understanding the core knowledge that is needed to build either a vs code extension or a vs code folk or a Devon like application that you know automatically creates PRS in your uh code base and tries to solve it understand his comments on it so on and so forth with that we'll move to the next one um next one is finally non AI related U this one I've just kept as a side section which is cyber security and devops one sort of need U that the company would always have would be to make sure someone is maintaining the infrastructure um and of course cyber security something that wouldn't be a Thing If humans weren't dumb um I humans leave out things human humans leave out security vulnerabilities which bug bounty hunters find and then you know get paid and something similar will happen with AI even if AI is writing code there's a high probability it leaves out some level of vulnerabilities so these are two job roles that you will always need a person for irrespective of you know what kind of AI comes even I think if AI comes um you will need someone to hold accountable SL scream and yell at SL wake up in the middle of the night um if your things go down so learning devops um and it's really hard to find devops Engineers were really good um and by devop I don't mean you know you're able to deploy an application on a VM I mean you understand how you can scale applications infrastructure code moving to various clouds U making sure you're uh you know maintaining Cloud costs negotiating with Cloud providers developer productivity cicd tools U testing integration so on and so forth so all of these uh you will need someone to own um not a lot of people know this really well like compared to the number of web developers the number of people who know devop Val is really less so you know that is one market if you want to stay away from the crowd or if you're extremely U saturated in your job right now um then you know you should look at but this involves a number one you know some initial investment so keep that in mind voice standard you need Cloud access you know to play with a few machines spend some money there you know don't think twice before running some experiments on various Cloud providers and number two um I think these fields may you really learn something well if you're working in a company that hits scale U otherwise you just deploy it to a v VM I've talked to a lot of startups in India Jo the engineers say we just have a VM we deployed the database there the database crashed and then you know we lost data for a few hours U to you wouldn't really learn or you know get good at devops if you're working in such a company um the way to get good at devops is to work at a company that's really hit scale now and has you know cost optimizations to do even if you save them 10% of the bill that's a really big number for example one of our students got into a quick Commerce company and he shared that their their monthly AWS bill was somewhere around a mill uh per month so if you can save 10% you're saving you know 80 lakh rupes to the company um which frankly isn't too hard to do in Cloud even through negotiations you can save this much money um and if not negotiating you know you you can you can find ways to squeeze out profits of course a company that's in quick Commerce right now doesn't need to squeeze any profits U but in the long run you know as a devops engine these are places you can provide value you'll only be able to provide that value if youve joined the company that's hit scale U though unfortunately there's no very easy path to learn you know devops unless you join a company um that's not true for let's say you know mobile development or web development or even backends so I would suggest you know you start to own infrastructure of a company and you know that's how you start to learn devops for cyber security um there are two parts you either go through a certification there are various you know commonly available certifications that people do but a lot of cyber SEC people that I know are just naturally gifted um they've been in hacking websites since they were young they've always been interested in reverse engineering binaries or you know going through standard web attacks and attacking a bunch of websites and slowly you know moving from a black hat to again this one isn't a very clear path either but I can tell you this this one's lucrative number one it pays really well to be one of the you know higher paid bug bounty hunters if you get into the right circles if you're doing well on Buck Crow or hacker 1 um you'll get invited to private U inspections of these companies and and when you do that you you can make I mean the best ones make like 2 three Mill a year um that said um I also got my recent job through U finding a fairly severe vulnerability in you know one of these AI platforms so that also sort of told me companies whenever they come that also was a telling sign for me okay um even without giving an interview just because you know I was able to figure my way around some very standard commonly available uh vulnerabilities I was able to get a job it's really hard to sort of replace uh you'll always need people to keep inspecting um websites and making sure they're safe so these are two again decent attack vectors even though cyber security is a little uh dilly dally by which I mean you know um it's is a little unstable because a company doesn't really need you on a retainer they probably will hire you make you do an audit and then you know won't need you later to make sure you're comfortable with that lifestyle um but for devops game pretty blue ocean over there I think U companies would always need someone on call U especially if you join a big company there's like so much you can do it's always an interesting team to join with that we'll move to the next one this one is this one's again non AI uh browser based XYZ uh so there's canva there's nid or you know a bunch of other company let's see if I have another one there's Google spreadsheets um a lot of these applications were desktop applications before uh Premier Pro is still a fairly used um desktop application spreadsheets were something people used to have locally but eventually all of this moved uh to the cloud and to websites there are many benefits of you know having these tools as websites U biggest one being you know collaboration everyone's the mle size is really small you don't have to download a full binary you can just open a website and hit the ground running um but the problem is building these applications is really hard your browser isn't super powerful there's a signal JavaScript thread running that's processing everything so if you want to do video processing if you you want to do video editing inside the browser if you want to store a very big spreadsheet that has a million rows um you have to optimize it somehow and the the way you optimize It Is by using web workers and you know not just restricting yourself to the single thread that the browser provides you um so this specific niche of front ends that will be very hard for an AI to replicate is another Vector for you to learn it's basically going one step ahead of uh standard websites that you can build um these are the challenging bits in in a front end I think well there are other challenging bits is it's hard to design front ends I think that will always be a useful skill but more than that um I think doing computationally hard things in the browser is something not a lot of people know very well another good example here is if you ever want to do a video background removal like Google meet does U that's also really hard to do in the browser because again a single thread is doing 30 FPS uh video processing then it will not be able to do other things so all of that happens usually in a web worker so what are web workers how do they run how do they make sure okay you know your browser thread is free to do other things um while the heavy lifting is offloaded um over there that's a nice problem to solve if you're trying to build an end2end video editor that's web based um then understanding what exactly gets stored in the browser how exactly the video finally gets rendered probably on a server are interesting you know things to know because yeah as I said these are not simple websites so there's something extra on top of you know the standard designing a website and building a website and State Management that you have to do with that we'll move to the well there are two more points after this um which are Super intriguing but also super hard unless you're going for a Masters or a PhD um these are image generation and and score machine learning as you could have guessed U I think a few years ago it was like really hard to do to code as well like standard websites uh but over time you know you get people talk about it people get smart and then eventually you everyone knows how to build a website today I think that'll be true for U ml AI image generation L LMS whatever you want to learn um and you're very early right now um and we're also very early right now um only you know probably a handful of people know llms really well so if I really had the time honestly if I had the time energy and money to move to the US for a few months I'd probably go for a masters in these um but since I don't have that um I just have to figure out ad hoc ways which is either going to be talking to my batchmates or currently doing phds or other way to you know learn these Technologies um I've written a few of these down the first one being uh image generation I think video Generation image generation is doing fairly well now and there will be use cases that come out other than you know virtual only fan models um we've been using it fairly well in you know a bunch of our videos thumbnails the are like very small use cases honestly there's a lot that can be done you know stock footages can be replaced U yeah there are many use cases that maybe aren't fairly obvious right now um but at the bottom of it is going to be M Generation Um so how does does you know image generation actually happen how does face swapping happen um what are diffusion models what was the first diffusion model what is stable diffusion how is it different from let's say ideogram or the other one that I forgot the name um all of these have papers thankfully that you can read through not that it's going to be easy that's why I said it's easier to go for a masters where you can find a community that's you know doing this really well there's not a lot of publicly available knowledge as to or you know broken down tutorials as to how this is Works under the hood um I'm not talking about like building something on top of these that you can always do I'm actually talking about understanding how diffusion models work or you know how images do get generated um if you give a specific prompt um that's one and the other one is of course um it's core machine learning uh neural networks but eventually building up to something like Transformers and llms um that's the second uh very obvious you know thing to learn which will stay for a while will be a valuable skill will get you a job so on and so forth because you already know I mean there's a lot of funding there highest Roi companies highest VC multiples are coming to you know companies like openi which probably makes sense because if build something new it's very hard to build there's a very strong Mo only three four companies will eventually be able to do it really well and hence it makes sense to learn these U this probably for me would involve you know going to the standard andng U grind for a few months um then there's this video that's really good that explains the Transformer architecture and then of course there's the car Party video that will get you started on how to build a very basic llm at that point I would you know start to look out for either talking to a professor or a junior roles which are honestly hard to find in ml that'll probably be the way to get into you know ml uh without going for a Masters or a PhD U but this is Uncharted Territory I don't think a lot of people have you know taken that path directly right now but this honestly feels like the most rewarding path in the long run because this is what is really disrupting you know whatever that's standard full stack that would probably be the most lucrative path in the long run um I'm still deciding I mean there are a lot of points that I've talked about here each has its own you know put out a few points each has its own merits and you know dem merits um but let's create a study group maybe I don't know let me think about this U where you know we pick a few of these every month and try to study them um honestly if I if I look at the list the most interesting ones to me are image and video Generation Um that's probably number one then it's going to be agents purely because um one the hot thing in the town and two U if there like real use cases that can be buil so there'll be a lot of companies that make a lot of money here um then it'll be uh developer tools vs code auto complete GitHub PR so on and so forth then it be browser automation um because it's just very easy um then it'll be core ml probably uh browser BAS b u XYZ web workers and then well tough choice between this and devops and cyber security yeah this would be my list um in terms of you know top priority to the lowest U and maybe in the comments I'll do seven comments on each one of these titles just up vote on which one you're learning um or you know what's your top pick to learn next year and then based on that we can create the study group and go from there U the study group would most mostly be you know silent learning every week I don't know it's very hard people like lose motivation fairly quickly so it'll probably start off very strong and then eventually die out um so for that reason we we'll see how we structure it um but let's see what where your core interest lies and we go from there all right cool that's all I had for this one I will see you guys in the next one bye-bye

There is a burning question that what difference do you see in the market of 2023 and 2024, is it improving or is it going bad, whatever layoffs and many other things happened in 2022, especially in the tech industry, after that things started picking up in 2023 and in 2024 full scale hiring is going on with every company that I probably know of.there are lot of people in India, that means the supply is much more than the demand, but thankfully now the demand is also coming more and the work is also very good in India, like I said it is a good news for us that India is the next big growth center for most of the companies, well some ATS scoring also happens, is it true that companies use that to shortlist resumes, for example, suppose there are 100 applicants, if 100 people have applied, then ATS score is basically how well designed your resume is for that particular job role, what is that thing in the resume due to which most of the people get rejected? The first thing is that the resume may not reach me at all, like you said, ATS right, so keep the formatting correct in it and remove pi charts etc. So that could be one reason that your resume did not get shortlisted. It is better to take a referral from someone or it is better to go directly and apply on the career portal. Referral is better obviously because a person from the same company is vouching for you. you will not see my college or my last company, my CGPA? Hey everyone, welcome to a new episode. So today we have Pankhuri with us, Pankhuri is a recruiter at Google. So we have asked many questions to her. Let's Start with a short introduction. My name is Pankhuri. I am a recruiter, like you said, with around almost 10 years of experience. Majorly, I have hired in Data science and analytics all my life. But when I join Google,this is my stinct of hiring for SWE(Software Engineering) Now I hire mostly for senior roles,Senior IC & EM roles but ya, before we get into the podcast I would like to say that anything that I say is not Google's specific It is going to be general,market standard specific Whatever i know of the market & in whatever way i can help with Alright so let's start with the very first burning question what difference do you see in the market of 2023 and 2024 ? is it improving or is it going bad. no it is definitely improving very good improvement is coming in fact, in 2022 whatever lay offs and many other things happened in the tech industry especially after that in 2023 things started to pick up and in 2024 full scale hiring is going on with every company that I probably knew of , but this is not true for every geography it is true for India because India has amazing tech talent, half of the Silicon Valley is Indians right. so now we are retaining our India home grown talent, and companies are investing a lot in growing : India as a tech centre. alright so the market for India is getting better right I think most of our audience is from India so this is good news for them, okay next question is before that don't you think a lot of people were sitting, who were laid off from last year who could not get a job, the freshers must be a part of the crowd definitely freshers are also sitting because at that point there has not been that much hiring in the last two years and a lot of laid off employees are also sitting a lot of job seekers are preparing but the companies have become a little more specific & strict about the interview process they have higher standards and higher benchmarks , so if earlier with a little hard work one could crack an interview then you will have to work harder and especially the freshers because they don't have any putting they don't have anything on their resume so you have to work a little harder to get the job that you are aiming right. well being a recruiter it must be a very hectic job for you meaning you have to see a lot of resumes right yes I am glad that somebody says it is a very hectic job, yes have to see a lot of resumes it depends on which skill you are hiring for it is not that you have to see a lot of CVs for every skill if you are hiring for a very niche skill then there are no resumes in that much market. what will you screen and half the time, people are making useless resumes so the thing is that there is no number specifically how many resumes we see for a day or something but yes definitely it varies on which skill we are hiring for. all right well there is ATS scoring also right. Yes :) like is it true that companies use that to Shortlist resumes. I hope you're enjoiying the video,before moving forward i want to tell you about Lerarnyard's 3rd DSA batch We've launched our 3rd DSA batch on Leranarnyard currently basics topics are moving in depth & DSA hasn't started yet.but it will kick off soon So if you haven't enrolled & want to learn DSA, Do checkout the link in description. Let me tell you about it: it's a 6 month course, which has already started with basics of programming in first month you will have two options,Java & C++ you can code completely in either Java or C++ you get Class Notes,Live classes with Extra recorded lectures including problem solving You get a wonderful TA support,when you have a doubt you can raise tickets.TA will resolve your doubts Either on chat or video call,you're going to get a semmless experience, & we're going to cover 500 problems Along with that you'll have contests,bounty& much more. so just checkout the link in the description The timings will be 09-11 pm ,so it won't be a problem for college going or working people with eve classes so if you want to learn DSA do checkout link in description, Let's meet in the course now Let us continue with the video now so companies don't use it specifically okay. so it is a very automated thing,there is ATS score but it's not like the recruiter is going and looking at your ATS score otherwise suppose there are 100 applicants then ATS score is basically how well designed your resume is for that particular job role and job description suppose I have posted a machine learning role and you have applied for that and if you have only put software engineer or general software engineering keywords then your ATS score will be low it's because ATS score basically sort of works like a recommendation engine okay the more frequently you put the keyword or relevant keyword on that basis : ATS is an application tracking system so basically it screens and it pushes your resume up. so if your resume has more SWE related work written in it and if someone else like my resume and it has more ML and AI related work written in it. then my resume will come higher up. Got it, so basically whatever resumes have been collected on your job portal, then there is filtration in it, filtration or recommendation is done,it gets sorted, you can find the one that has a better ATS score and that depends on multiple factors like your keywords, your formatting and stuff in some cases formatting doesn't impact your ATS score, formatting just makes it not possible for the ATS to read your resume, okay, if there is bad formatting then it will not be able to give him an ATS score, it will not be able to give it because it will not be able to screen, if you have used pie charts, diagrams and all these, then it will not be able to screen and nowadays we have a lot of tools, we have Canva and all these, should I take names, you can take, okay, so nowadays we have a lot of tools like Canva and there are many other resume building tools and we get excited and put many pie charts and graphs and such and such on them but that should not be added Your resume should be ATS friendly and that means just write important things, focus on the content. Great,So when you look at a resume, suppose that resume gets qualified in ATS system and that comes into our recommendation, then you are going to see that resume right. So where do you see that resume? So what is that thing which attracts you in that resume? What is the first section that you see? So it is not about the section but it is about the content and I will be attracted by what you want to show me. Okay, so that's why resume designing and building is very crucial in your job hunt because I will see only what you want to show me because I will have to see 100 resumes if Fraz has written it. That okay if I am looking for a guy who does ML and he has written four words like random forest and such and such, then my first focus will go there. So he has worked in NLP, so whenever Natural Language Processing is written in bold, somewhere at the beginning, he has made a project, he has done some work somewhere or he has written the skills, just keywords, keywords have to be put but to be put smartly and relevant, but yes keywords are very very important, so put that, bold it, highlight it, the first thing that your recruiter sees is what you want to show, like this, yes, if you highlight what you want to show, you will be selected like this and then you know we sort of reach out to the candidates and set up a meeting where more discussion happens on what you have actually done, but resume work on the basis of keywords, I guess got it, you will not see my college or my last company or my CGPA. In freshers, yes. you can look for freshers because for freshers college etc matters, your GPA matters, and companies do matter a bit, naturally if you are coming from a competing firm and do similar sort of work then it becomes attractive because we know that you might have done similar work or if you have worked on similar products then it becomes more attractive, but good companies generally consider it as bias and we don't do it because on the basis of company why we would hire someone, it should hire on the basis of skill, but that is the ideal world scenario, so yes definitely companies do matter if you are an experienced professional but not as much I would say as far as you know the skills we like, we as in like entire recruiting fraternity, we don't have that bias, we want to push you, we want to take your profile to the hiring manager, but GPA and college definitely matters if you are a Fresher so first write that if you are coming from NIT IIT then that is your you know USP so you should highlight that on top of the resume. yes now mostly the audience is from tier three very honestly yes so what should a tier three person do what should I highlight because he doesn't have a college okay I don't know about CGP or if he has worked hard then it will happen if he hasn't done it then that too won't happen so what should they highlight first I want to say that college doesn't matter it does matter initially for you to get your foot in the door for the interview, it will matter in campus placement after that it won't matter, but you are a fresher and you are coming from a tier three college you have to do it. most of the people want IIT NIT people right so in that you should highlight your projects a little,link your git profile how many problems have you solved. If you have projects, highlight them highlight your internships because then your work will speak for you, at that time the college will not talk about it, so how can you highlight your work, that also in keywords that I have done this in all these, these are your codathones or if there are these certifications, highlight all those things, then that will make it attractive to your recruiter that yes I am also not getting a person from a very good and wonderful college but he has done a lot of work, so you will get a chance there alright and one more scenario, lot of people are working at services companies as well as TCS, especially the complaint that ours Resumes do not get shortlisted that may be because they are working in services company so what should they highlight because they have experience now, three to four years of experience so what should they highlight should they also make projects, yes projects yes because it is a very natural thing that recruiters of product companies would like to take employees from product companies because there is similar setup and it will take less time for you to ramp up and many things happen, hiring manager is also more comfortable because culture is also another thing culture is different so I think in this case also what have you done in your projects and not just in your company, then you have to work a little more if that is a product company aspiration of yours work a little more and do extra work in a few more projects do one of your side projects again you can also participate in the story even as an experienced professional because that shows your coding skills and may be you have problem Solving skills, Data structures, right, so if you highlight all those things, then there is a high possibility that your CV will be shortlisted, but yes, this is a challenge and to combat to this, a little bit more extra effort has to be put in,quite Great anyway it will be a challenge because there are a lot of people in India, that is, the supply is much more than the demand, yes, but thankfully, now the demand is also high and very good work is also coming in India, like I said it's a good news for us that India is the next big growth center for most of the companies and then there is a lot of investment happening, so hope fully fingers crossed, a lot of people will get a lot of jobs and with what ever happened in 2022-2023 I think now we need some respite from that as well, the kids were in complete tension, that is, the freshers they were like less aimless people that now we are in the final year, what will we do You will not get a job after this and people also have a lot of fear that if you do not get a job immediately after college and you sit at home for one or two months or six or seven months, then after that no one will hire you because you have a career gap. Is it true? A career gap does matter, but when everyone knows that such a situation has happened, like I am not a campus recruiter, I may not be the best person to say this, but it does not matter because we all know how last year went, we also know how the year before that went, so we want to give this opportunity to the kids who did not get it, so it would not matter, it is again like I said a bias which is discouraged in good companies, okay, so those things will not matter as far as it is like a global thing that has happened, but yes, definitely if everything is hunky dory and everything is going well, still your placement did not happen due to any reason, then If you see a gap, they will ask you a question about the gap. You have to justify it. Justify it and do it very smartly. Whatever you are doing, if you have not got placed by chance and if you are a student, please work on as many projects as you can and make your resume as attractive as possible so that you have solid content to justify the gap. Yes, recently there are a lot of startups that are specifically hiring people who have been laid off. Yes, they're looking for people from Google , Amazon, Microsoft because they know the reason was business requirement students who did not get placed and they have to sit, so people know that they are talented. It is just that there was no business requirement for hiring. There is no need to take so much stress. Not at all. There is no need to take stress. You have seen that even in normal market scenarios, you get off-campus placements. It is not necessary that even if you are from a very good premier institute, It is not necessary that you will get a very good package and you will get a job in a very good company. Even if you are deserving, I have seen off-campus placements of very good students and there are many such examples who are coming from tier three and tier two colleges and they are very imensly successful. So there is no need to take tension in this. Don't get de-motivated. Don't get disheartened. It is going to be okay. If not today, then tomorrow you will get a job. Just keep working hard. Skills are very relevant, actually, as long as you know your work. Especially in the tech space where you are in and all of us are in a may be your audience is also in. So in the tech space, especially skills matter a lot. You should know how to code. You should know how to solve problems. You should be clear about Data structures and algorithms. If you have good skills in all these, then sooner or later you will find your fitting in the industry. All right, great. So, Pankhuri Let's take a little more about resume for sometime, so what is that thing in the resume due to which most of the people get rejected even after you know if your resume is shortlisted by I mean recommended by ATS,then on which basis you reject it okay the first thing is that the resume might come to me like you said ATS then keep the formatting correct in it and remove the pi charts etc. so that could be one reason that your resume did not get shortlisted second if I am looking at it and I am seeing the resume and I am not a recruiter & you are a finance person and I am a tech recruiter If a resume comes to me for whatever reason, you have written machine learning in one or two places and I am hiring for machine learning, then it will definitely come, if I am screening 50, then that resume should be right at 45th place because the keyword is there but it will be rejected because your relevant skill is not in accordance with the job description, I am hiring for it, okay, third it can happen that your resume also gets rejected because you have written the keywords, just to make your CV visible, but there is no story around it, yes, I have seen many people make a box and put five or six keywords in it and that works against them, right, so this is a recent thing, just yesterday I was actually talking with my hiring manager and I was screening the resume with him and I asked him, I said how is this looking and we both kept reading and kept laughing because , The words are written but they have not done any work on it, got it, so that's where your recruiter, your hiring manager, they are very smart to understand that you have done some story telling around it, some story weaving, on which project have you used this skill to do this work, the dots should be connected, the dots should be connected, so make it relevant, make it crisp, again if you write a lot of stories at once, even then I will reject it, I don't know if I will read that much, I hardly spend five, six, seven seconds, an average recruiter spends on a resume, so I hardly spend that much time, it is true, actually it is a fact, so if you have written a lot of stories which do not make any sense, then that too gets rejected, okay, great, according to the priority different sections of the resume, tell me which section does your attention go to first, the first thing you look at is actually with my experience, now the professional summary, if you have written it well, I read it, but if it is not written well, then first of all I go down to see which company you have worked in and then I start looking at what projects you have done. Okay, but if seen in order wise, first of all your name, contact details, your LinkedIn should be there, your email, phone number, and don't put a photo, the recruiter is not interested in seeing your photo, I don't understand why they put it, I also haven't understood till date, but so this is not really important, your home address is also not important, may be your city is important for location, the recruiter should know where you are from and then after that you write a professional summary, put a gist in it and nowadays there are so many generative AI tools in which you can craft very easily, you just give them keywords and they will write a nice paragraph for you, very simple, very process and brief, so if the professional summary is attractive, then I will read it, otherwise I will go straight to work experience, yes work experience is like you have worked with say Google & then some other company before it, I will see what you've done in Google,Microsoft i will read it then i'll see ,that too in a hury as we're busy and whatever keywords are there in it if they are highlighted then I will also take that much effort otherwise I just skim through it so so yes all these things come under your work experience so your contact means introduction section then there is your professional summary then there is work experience then there is your college in education and you can add a skills section as well where you can what skills are you working on.may be you working on python and you working on other java javascript and something like that and then lastly if you want to if it is too important for you you can do your hobbies as well that is that is a bonus pointer because in hobbies also it is now, now there is a culture where we want to know more aspects of you so if you host a show If you are a youtuber then that certainly shows that you are a somebody who will interact with people who would be able to do that,so if it's related to your current job description so that kind of adds to the value. okay for those who don't have work experience may be they can put project in that section right or those who don't have work experience they have less content so in the work experience section,you can put your internships you can put your projects and whatever codathon,hackathon you have participated you can also mention that in this case I would say you should put your college a little higher if you have a very premier college then put the logo yes your profile picture may be not needed but IIT-B logo will be helpful right so you can do that you can give it priority a little instead of you know your work experience alright Pankhuri so the next question is whether it is better to take a referral from someone or go directly for Applying on the career portal is better, getting a referral is better obviously because a guy from the same company is vouching for you, sort of some times from the background he gives feedback, if he doesn't know you that well then he will tell that I don't know them well but I find them relevant and secondly the advantage of that is that firstly he is vouching for you, secondly he will get a referral bonus right, then he will also follow up for you, so he will get a referral from the recruiter Will follow up directly. If you are such an external applicant and you are sending me 50 messages on LinkedIn and if any colleague of mine in my own company is sending me even one message that Pankhuri I had sent this profile, what happened to it, then I will definitely reply to him out of courtsey right, so the visibility of your resume increases a lot. Referrals are extremely important. If you are not getting anyone, then you do not have any option, you go and apply directly and then you can reach out to the recruiter, and whatever people are there in the company, you can reach out to them by connecting with them but if you know somebody,there's nothing better than that. correct, but before that the important thing is that you make yourself so capable that the person is also agreeing to refer you and at the same time he is also taking follow up for you, he is sitting and waiting that he is going to get a bonus and this candidate is capable. Of that, you will have to work on those skills first before directly going through references, unless you are my uncle's son or my maternal uncle's son, nobody will take this much effort to follow up for you, so you build credibility, you work well and I think people will speak for you, people in general, I feel are helpful, they have the intention to help, so definitely if you reach out to anyone and if your work is good, they will refer you right I have also heard that there are many companies that if their employee has referred you to someone, then the recruiter will definitely see the resume at least once : 100% 100% like I said that if you are an external applicant and you are calling me four times, which a lot of people do, you should not do this, but if you know, you have a colleague of mine and he is following up, dropping a message, sending an email as well, I am bound to respond to you them that is only professional so that is the easiest way to get into a company why I am laughing because when you said that you should not call directly, there is a podcast in which I actually discuss this what is the best way to reach out to recruiters so there was my guest in that podcast he said cold calling, oh okay no no no please don't do cold calling it gives a very bad impression about you now if you're desperate enough it's not it works totally against you,i'm getting a call like Hi Pankhuri so first of all it looks like an unprofessional attitude but the ideal way again if you have a phone number then drop a message drop it right first text after that you can call,right if you are cold calling that that doesn't work honestly that gives a very bad impression about you and in that he also told the method of how to get the number so yes that is our method we are recruiters, We know how to get numbers so that is not a problem but again when we as recruiters get your numbers we still probably,we don't text and text but very rarely email comes yes and phone also if someone is doing cold calling which is the job of recruiters honestly right at one point then also we ask is it a right time to talk and there are ways to build you a repo and be polite and professional so yes be polite even if it has come to that stage that yes now something has to happen only by calling if nothing is coming from anywhere then call and say I am sorry for calling you directly but this is the situation and I really hope you can help me with that all right okay so but that is the last resort when absolutely nothing is happening the situation is bad then it is okay, the situation is bad but still don't call no matter how bad the situation is don't call because it it will be taken against you I am Sure all right then the second thing is how to reach out to recruiters if you cannot call and are getting very few replies to your emails so what is the best way to reach out to them okay so if you go on Linkedin and you see a job on career section then you pick that job and copy paste it in the linkedIN,it's a hack If you click on the job,you get recruiter at the bottom Sometime,it won't as we can enable it and then you send the message him there on linkedIN , Hi,i've see this job & you're hiring for this role then you send a brief summary that why am i good for this role then you send the msg That's how you can reach out,so that recruiter like I am hiring for an engineering manager if a fresher is pinging me why will I reply right I don't have that time nobody has that time so if you are hiring a fresher if you are a fresher and looking for a job if you see the recruiter below then do it otherwise if you don't see it then go to that company and put up its talent acquisition put up recruiters ping all the people that brother I am looking for a job can you connect me With Somebody, who can help me,like hiring for this role,that will probably have more chances I also get 100s of messages,how i would've not replied then it's because of that how many of them i can reply But if i see right from the top, I saw that I am an engineering manager and so and so company, I will immediately open that message because I know that I am hiring for that role, so you have to focus there as well, majorly. all right, so directly reaching out to recruiters does it help is better than referrals also. no, nothing is better than references, but reaching out to recruiters definitely helps because if I am sourcing and today I have to see how many messages have come to my LinkedIn and if you are relevant then there are high chances that I will respond back to you, if you are not relevant and I have seen your message, maybe I can leave it on read and maybe then if I see that it is a good profile and I have many 10 recruiter friends in the industry and they are also hiring in the company, then I can forward it to them as well all right yes great that's the but this is yes. the easiest way to get in is referral than is recruiters and you can also reach out to the hiring managers there is nothing like that okay yes so hiring managers will refer you and they will simply refer you I mean that definitely if the hiring manager is saying that this profile is relevant for my role why would a recruiter even take waste two seconds to call you right so if you are a hiring manager and you are telling me that Pankhuri this candidate is perfect for the role then I will call you immediately your interview will take place immediately the hiring manager has already sold off on your resume so what is stopping you just start preparing for your interviews.ya great thanks a lot for this information because many people don't know what is the best way to reach out people simply put their resume anywhere and then they expect that they will get a reply immediately so you Have to be a little careful while you are applying try to take a referral if not a referral try to reach out to a recruiter and hiring manager of that company work a little hard friend and write a nice message on LincedIN means don't leave hi hello ,write proper message yes hi pankhuri and just hi hi after that when the message comes then reply then reply why should I who are you why will I reply so yes correct you have to brother no very well you can use your generative AI tools ah I'm trying not to take names so use generative AI tools and use Gemini you guys yes use Gemina use Gemina to draft your content and draft your message it is very easy these days to at least communicate right so now we talked about how a candidate can reach out to a recruiter but in my case I was reached out by a google's recruiter & that's how I got selected so how do you guys like all the recruiters you reach out to people where do you search and how do you search for candidates or so there are many platforms like naukri like linkedin right there are multiple such platforms like IM jobs is one platform and there are many platforms on which recruiters search okay and there are also internal tools internal portals internal Databases on which we search so our search is like google,we put keywords & we start looking at each & every profile that comes up Like you were asking ATS score ,this is the answer giht,that if i put it on internal portal on my ATS. Like i'm hiring for this keyword.so how quick you appear at the top and it is based on your ATS score,higher the ATS score. Sooner your profile will appear in front of recruiteri.e; Better ranking. Like when GOogle recruiter must've reached you out it would be either on internal Databases.it came from linkedIN yes so if you yes then linkedIN is also a huge platform that recruiters use then in that also you will see your CV or maybe they will send you an email and then you respond so this is how we scout for profiles this is basically sourcing is what we call it once we have sourced we reach out to the people and if your profile is relevant that In the initial screening call, the recruiter asks you questions like which project you have worked on, which tech stack you have used, all of those things, after that your interview process starts, understood so what is the most frequent internal tool, the first priority is internal tool because people have actively applied for it, so that also kind of solidifies that the candidate is also interested in this role, that is the top most obviously then of course LinkedIN right, LinkedIN is a huge platform across the globe, so there is a very large network of people and almost every professional right now will be on LinkedIN Correct Naukari.com I used to use it earlier for more junior roles when I was working for a little bit more junior roles, mid manager kind of roles, so or alright.So do you have some tips on LinkedIN to make a better profile,so for LinkedIN.how to make your profile better? if you think about,there are multiple aesthetic aspects of it & there is content aspect of it first find a good profile picture it shouldn't be a casual,like in plain background a good Headhsot,to rate that too to make a good profile Picture and rank my profile Picture rank my LinkedIn profile and on that basis you can improve your profile then there should be a good cover picture as well which should reflect your skills and the area and the industry that you are working in then after that of course your first thing should be that again what do you want to show what do you want to attract people with so for example if it is yours then first of all you will write uber right and then you will say may be you are looking for tech roles so these are one of the few things that you are best known for right you could be best hired for if I'm looking for a techie I might get your resume company and then you can write your college may be if you if you are coming from a premier institute and then your summary text is of one line so just like your bio,yes in the same way your LinkedIn bio you will not write like insta bio. In LinkedIN's bio you will tell what kind of professional you are in just one sentence. Right? You need to be hired for correct reason. You should not write this in it like hustler, no no, not at all. Traveler, no no, traveler, hustler, blow candles on 14th march. You should not write all this. You should not write it on insta also Honestly it is very bad but yes, it means you need a very professional headline and after that in your career summary you should write it like you write in a resume. Right that basically to catch your eyes but again I would say that work experience is something that is visible first. First of all the headline is visible on LinkedIN, so definitely after that when you come down, you should put a little bit of project in it also. What work have you done or what is your team's Sometimes your team also makes a lot of difference in which team you are working this is for experienced professionals of course correct if not then there are other good things in LinkedIN like you can add skills you can get endorsement for that skill you can get recommendations written from your colleagues your friends and that plays a huge role right if I am a recruiter I am looking at I have 50 tech profiles in which one has so many recommendations and every person is praising I worked with them and he is an amazing professional he knows this tech stack and I vouch for this so that in itself is a validation that yes this guy does this work this work well correct so add all those things and certifications and all these things pop up separately for you in LinkedIN anyway that is very important that you can definitely do all right great good tips for LinkedIN so Let's say a candidate goes through an interview process now okay his resume has been shortlisted you have also scheduled his interview so you also get the feedback right as to why he got rejected yes so what are the top three reasons why candidates get rejected once they are in the interview okay okay so one thing is a primary thing I would say particularly in tech before you understand the problem statement because you have come with so much preparation that before understanding it you start thinking about the solution so you don't even listen to the problem statement first and this problem is a very massive problem because even if you were able to solve it you have heard the problem statement but you didn't understand it correctly and sometimes what happens is that the interviewer is giving you a question but you will ask his expectation right what is X, so he takes a little information with hold or he is not even holding with hold so it is a straight forward question. You design some product and the name of that product is this and it has these features, then you are not asking clarifying questions. This is a big mistake, a problem. As soon as your statement comes, the interview problem statement comes, the interviewer tells you to ask for some time from him, think about it. I am sure the interviewer will understand that you need time to think before you get into the solution and after that you start answering. You have solved 50 questions in lead code, even 100 -thousand. Fitting it in the context of the problem statement, fitting your skill is very important. You code very well but that's what matters when you understand the problem. So that is one second,I would say that there are a lot of things about the attitude as well. right, a good company these days are looking for people who are inclusive, have the right attitude, believe in doing the right thing.so that thing is very important you should always give politically correct answers in any way right your attitude should not be visible in which you are not a team player all these values ​​of yours should be reflected that you are a good team player you think about team goals or the individual goals right all of these things make you leave a great impression rest if you are not able to do tech, you are not able to solve the problem then that is a different story but even if you know these things well even then these things give a negative impact on your interview right so ya these are the two things that I can think apart from the fact that if you are not able to solve the problem. how do you feel when you give an offer to someone when you get a call for the offer that you have been selected or it is the best feeling in the world as a recruiter I am sure everybody Another recruiter on earth will probably relate with me because you are working with that person. you are scheduling interviews you are preparing them for interviews so you form a bond and a repo and it is also my job right I want the role to get closed with the best candidate I want my hiring manager to be happy with the hire but I want my candidate also to be happy right so that is the best feeling in the world that is my job everyday that is my when your code runs the happiness you feel in the same way I feel very happy to make an offer okay that's it i got the call on saturday.although i try to refrain from saturday's but if it makes somebody happy then we can go that extra mile or when it was Friday I did not get the offer on Friday I was like now for the next three days again this will come in my dreams that am I getting the offer or not. many candidates tell me if you had given me one I would have got one .There is a candidate and a festival was about to come up they were like these are the holidays and I'm really hoping something works out okay and you know so even if I'm not able to relate. I really want it to work out for them, to some candidate that I have to sign the offer letter at this time itself oh so that thing is interesting for me it's not like I am getting offended in the fact it is interesting for me that yes okay meaning it is not affecting me much ,my SLA is not being affected,it's not my SLA the company also has a rule right that the offer is valid for this much time and you have to sign within this much time so if you are signing within that time then nothing like it right sign in your muhurta you sign during the holidays you have to celebrate some festival, you celebrate it it It is a good feeling how to negotiate with a great recruiter, it is very important and I am sure everyone this is on the top of the mind because let's face it we are all working for money so definitely we should negotiate one, don't pack down don't hedge and never tell the recruiter what your expectation is Never give the first number yourself okay because if the recruiter can give you 10 lakhs and you say 8 lakhs then he will be able to give you only 8 lakhs and it is not like the money is going out of our pocket it is going out of the company's pocket the company is paying you but then if you have given us an expectation that okay I want 8 lakhs and I also have a budget of 10 lakhs why would I give you that extra 2 lakhs right unless I am a very good recruiter and unless you know I feel that there would be it is may be not Documented anyway if you send an email saying my expectations are 8 lakhs then I will not do anything right but at the end of the day I have to think about the company as well as the candidate as well as the role of the hiring manager so for me everything is equal but how can you corner me like this if you don't tell me your expectations then I will give you an offer,sometimes what happens is that there is a chance of negotiation on that offer sometimes it doesn't happen at all it doesn't happen at all it happens zero okay then I will give you the offer and I will say that this is the offer you will say that this is not according to my expectations I need more then I will go back I will check with my comp-man team there are comp and man teams right okay where benchmarking is done and most of the companies most of the companies don't offer too much here and there from the average standard okay for a very good candidate I may be If you can give 10 lakhs, then it is possible to give 11 lakhs because he is a very good candidate, right, but we will not go above 11, there is a range, which means we will not give less than this minimum and we will not give more than this, because then the rest of the people will become unhappy, so if you are bringing a new hire in a team and he is getting a lot of money from someone who is already working then they will leave and this person is crucial for you because he has been working for a long time, he knows all this work, the new one will have to be taught, so no company mess with parity but it's your job to probably not share or show your cards too soon I did that, you did that I also did that being a recruiter, okay, mine was a fluke and a mistake, I regretted, but yes I did that, Okay Pankhuri, it was very insightful talking to you, I enjoyed talking to you a lot I got to know all the things personally and I hope our audience also got to know a lot. I hope so too so thank you so much for being here, rest, can I provide your LinkedIn if you don't mind: yes yes absolutely. so I will provide all her handles in the description but go prepared to her and don't raid me with messages especially on Instagram don't raid with messages that is my personal account,i don't recruit on instagram I recruit on LinkedIN,but yes i'll try to respond to you if it's possible It is very difficult to actually reply to all of the messages. we get 1000s of message every single day it becomes difficult to respond to everybody.but ya feel free to reach out.You never know when it get clicked & if it is in my capacity then i'll definitly help alright thank you so much for being here,It was nice talking to you do like the video, do subscribe to the channel if you are new here. see you in the next video bye bye

these AWS Cloud projects will give you such an unfair advantage that some people might call it cheating and no I'm not exaggerating just last week one of my students landed a six-figure job at AWS using these exact portfolio projects hi I'm slan I've worked in tech for a decade and today I run my own AI Cloud Security consultancy in this video I will share five AWS projects that will give you an unfair advantage in today's job market we start beginner friendly but each stage gets progressively harder to build your skills for the final Capstone project at the end and for each one we'll examine three key points the problem that IT addresses how to actually build it and finally the business impact that will make any hiring manager pay attention project number one is a smart static website but firstly what problem are we solving now look everyone can host a basic website on AWS that's old news what actually matters is building something secure fast and smart with your resources now you can't just dump and HTML file somewhere and call it a day think about it you've got hackers coming from everywhere users who will just bounce if your site takes more than a second to load and budgets which needs to be managed and that's the real problem that we're solving here for the tech stack we're going deep with AWS we'll start with S3 that's the foundation for our storage but here is where things get good we're going to plug in cloudfront to blast that content worldwide very fast security wise AWS certificate manager will handle https and we're throwing wff in front to block the sketchy traffic plus cloudwatch keeps an eye on everything with custom dashboards and alerts and here is why this hits different in interviews you are showing you get the whole picture it's not just oh look I can host a website you're building something that is secure Global and smart about your resources by the way make sure you wait for the Capstone project at the end that will make it impossible for you not to get hired project number two is our silent scalper now what's the problem that we're solving so companies that deal with data in the cloud are usually hit with two major roadblocks especially if the architecture hasn't been designed properly firstly they waste money on servers sitting idol most of the time secondly when traffic suddenly spikes their systems crash because they haven't provisioned any extra resources no one wins here either you're burning cash or you are losing data so we're going to build a serus pipeline that fixes this problem we'll start with S3 as our entry point any file that lands here automatically triggers a Lambda function this is the key because you're only paying when you're actually processing data the Lambda function processes these files it could be filtering data converting formats and whatever your business needs now when processing succeeds the data goes into Dynamo DB for quick access we chose Dynam DB because it scales instantly with your workload and if something fails maybe the files corrupted or Lambda times out we move it to a separate quarantine bucket for manual review this way bad data never breaks your system you'll Implement cloudwatch to track everything how many files you're processing you know how long it takes error rates and we'll set up SNS notifications for critical issues now if error ratees spikes or processing times get too high you will know immediately and if you need to expose this system to other applications API Gateway will give you a secure and controlled interface now this really matters because your data processing pipeline often needs to interact with external systems or applications now think of these projects as preparing you for the real world for example imagine you're building this for a medical imaging company their mobile data needs to upload x-ray scans and hospitals need to send patient records for processing API Gateway lets them do this securely without directly accessing your AWS resources so it handles authentication through API keys and IM roles encrypts data in transit and lets you Monitor and control exactly who's accessing what so even when you have thousands of hospitals sending sensitive data at the same time they can't access anything that they shouldn't but their data still flows through smoothly and securely now project number three is the Smart Vault so again what problem are we solving well in 2025 data loss can devastate the reputation of any business when your systems crash or someone wipes important files you're not just losing money you are losing customer trust and while everyone implements backups that alone is isn't enough with this project we are making those backups smart we're talking automatic correctly timed and not burning money on storage that you don't need now to do this we're going to be using EBS snapshots to back up our ec2 instances because they are incremental and you only pay for the change blocks of data event Bridge schedules these snapshots daily or hourly depending on how critical your data is because manual backups are prone to human error and here is exactly how we build it firstly we tag all the important ec2 instances with the flag of backup true this tag based approach gives us flexibility you can easily add or remove instances from the backup schedule without changing any code then we can write a Lambda function that does three things when event Bridge triggers it firstly it finds all the instances with our backup tag this makes the system Dynamic and scalable secondly it creates new snapshots and labels them with metadata such as data time and environment which is crucial for tracking and order to and thirdly it deletes any snapshots older than our retention period to prevent storage cost from ballooning then we use SNS notifications so you get an alert when backups happen or if something fails because you need to know immediately if your backup system isn't working Cloud watch will track your snapshot count and storage size which helps you optimize for costs and compliance and if you need extra redundancy we can use S3 to store these backups in different regions which is critical for Disaster Recovery scenarios as I always say data is the new oil and with this Cloud project you're showing you know how to save companies thousands if not millions of dollars by avoiding downtime and it helped them comply with regulatory requirements if they need certain data retained for a specific period now before we get to the next project which leverages AI if you're serious about building a portfolio of cloud projects then go check out my cloud engineer Academy where we dive in deep into the cloud and help people like you build Cloud expertise a number of our students got at AWS from being complete beginners so if you're interested go check out the link in my description below now project number four the AI customer service Bots and I know what you're thinking but this isn't just a no code or drag and drop AI chat bot that you see everyone else talking about now as Cloud Engineers we're actually uniquely positioned to take advantage of the AI boom because everything is deployed to the cloud and most people haven't even clocked onto this with that in mind we're going to solve two problems with this project number one a huge bottleneck for businesses is customer support as it relies purely on human agents number two everyone has tried to fix this problem by jumping onto no code chat Bots and drag and drop Solutions but they are hitting walls custom business logic security and Integrations need real code behind them and here is how we're going to build it firstly we need a way for customers to send messages to our bot this can be from your website from a mobile app or wherever the message hits our API Gateway which is just aws's way of letting external applications securely communicate with our system from there our Lambda function picks it up and does the smart work firstly it checks the message context is this a new conversation is it an ongoing issue we then pull any history from Dynamo DB then we structure a prompt for Amazon bedrock and we include the customer question relevant conversation history your company's tone guidelines specific business rules or restrictions Bedrock processes this and generates a response before sending it back our Lambda function will validate the response against any business rules adds necessary links or resources formats it to your Brand's voice and tags it for routing if it needs human attention for example if bedrock couldn't generate a response back and DB will track everything cloudwatch will make sure responses are fast and on point with SNS alerts if something is off now the magic here is that we are leveraging Ai and that will make you stand out anyone can connect to an AI API by Building A system that actually represents a brand and handles real business scenarios that's what the top 1% Cloud Engineers do which sets you up perfectly for project number five an intelligent doc engine our Capstone project so again what problem are we solving with this project businesses today are completely overwhelmed with documents medical records financial statements and compliance reports literally they have thousands of them and right now people are manually reading these trying to extract important information and it's becoming unmanageable it's slow it's expensive and crucial details get missed while some companies use basic OCR that just gives them raw text without any real understanding or insights the intelligent doc engine transforms this whole process starting with Amazon S3 as our document Foundation when any document arrives whether it's a PDF or an image or a contract it automatically triggers our processing workflow through Lambda and instead of basic OCR we will use Amazon Tech trct because it truly understands documents it re recognizes tables forms and the overall structure of documents but just extracting text isn't enough we use Sage maker to run machine learning models that do two crucial things firstly it turns document text into numerical representations that capture meanings I.E embeddings so our system can understand when different phrases mean the same thing for example Q4 Revenue hit 2 mil and fourth quarter Revenue reach 2 m mean the same thing so their numerical representations will be similar as well secondly it powers our question answering capability and letting users ask natural questions about their documents and get accurate answers drawn from relevant content now we store these embeddings in open search which lets us quickly find relevant information when someone asks a question the process is seamless when a user asks something we convert that question into the same type of numerical format find matching document sections and generate an accurate answer using the relevant context now to keep track of everything we use doid DB to store essential document information when it was processed who uploaded it and the current status this gives us instant access to document details when we need them and what makes this system truly powerful is how it keeps improving we've just built an mlops pipeline that collects data from user interaction automatically tests improvements and safely deploys better versions when the system encounters New documents or questions it learns and adapts becoming more accurate over time this is exactly what companies are desperately looking for in 2025 how to combine cloud services with machine learning and AI models you're literally helping them make sense of their data and saving them so much time now that said you can't build these projects without having fundamental Cloud knowledge under your belt which is why you need to watch this video right here where I break down the complete Cloud engineer road map for 2025

this has been a wild year in Tech I feel like it's been we've been put through the ringer the last year last two years with so many different Tech Innovations coming out so many different places we should put our Focus where do we even begin so I'm going to share with you today what you'll actually need to learn in 2025 to stay ahead of the tech curve and also to why it matters to do so here's something Wild by the end of 2025 the way we interact with computers will be completely different and I'm going to show you exactly why now I want to take you back sec in 1985 most people thought computers were just fancy calculators by 1995 they were connecting this to this thing called the internet now 2000 well not now but 2005 everyone had a flip phone 2015 everyone had a smartphone which really changed everything but here is what fascinates me every decade we don't just get better technology what we do get is we fundamentally change how we interact with it and right now we are at one of those key moments so let's start into the top five things we should be learning in [Music] 2025 first one is multimodal AI development you know how your phone can understand your voice read your text and recognize faces well that is just the beginning in 2025 AI systems will work more like our brains processing everything at once I mean think about it think about how you understand this video right now you're not just hearing my voice or my words you're seeing my gesture reading the text on screen understanding it all together that essentially is multimodal AI let me show you something wild see this BMW Factory they've built an AI system that works just like your most experienced mechanic it's watching for tiny defects in cars with cameras listening for weird engine sounds you know the concerning stuff that happens in a car and simutaneously reading through thousands of Maintenance logs last year alone this AI predicted failures so so accurately it saved BMW $10 million that's essentially multimodal AI in action not just seeing not just hearing but understanding everything at once just like you and me so we are all big Learners here we want to stay ahead of the tech curve where do we learn this one is deep learning AI has a multimodel machine learning course another is Stanford's cs231n which is for computer vision and the last one is fast. A's practical deep learning course so why does it matter to learn this every major tech company is building multimodal AI in their projects from social media Spotify YouTube everything they're all using AI that can understand multiple types of content at the same time and this is going to really set you apart in the job market number two is quantum ready programming okay now this might sound a little bit scary but stay with me here because I promise it's actually really fascinating quantum computers are coming there's no doubt about that and they're going to break a lot of things potentially let's just say potentially here including most of our encryption ways that we encrypt things right now I mean that's skeptical but it's pretty possible but here's the cool part quantum computers won't just break things they help us solve immense problems that we can't even approach today things like designing new medicines or predicting climate change or maybe even better yet how to solve if it's possible climate change okay now check this out remember Mna the vaccine company they're using quantum computers to do something incredible they're simulating how proteins fold which basically means watching molecules dance in ways traditional computers simply can't see they've cut their testing Time by 60% by partnering with IBM Quantum to make vaccines even faster which is pretty cool and here's the cool part they're not just using quantum computers they're building new security systems to protect patient data from future Quantum hackers that's pretty wild right and it makes me very happy that they're thinking about the hacking parts of it so if you are interested in Quantum Computing here are a few places that you can learn more about it one is IBM Quantum learning path this is a great course it's it's really interactive another is Microsoft's Quantum development kit a third is Q world's bronze silver gold training program so why does this matter companies are already preparing for Q day if you will where quantum computers can break current encryption Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and Google are all hiring Quantum ready developers now so this is something that if you want to stay in demand not only in 2025 but for a very long time in the future Quantum Computing is where it's at and there's so many great courses online some that we just listed for you to learn from the next one is extended reality okay I need to take these off because we need to actually have a talk but I've been really loving the Apple Vision Pro by the way it's I I made a full video using this and the new Macbook Pro with M4 Pro chip it's so good it's they're amazing anyways back to the point I had to get some props in here all right remember when phones were just for calling people I know it seems like forever ago now that's where VR is right now we're able to see spatial Computing change everything from how we work to how we shop but it's really just at the beginning let's use a real world example of how this is really used Ikea just revolutionized how we buy furniture and it's not with a better catalog imagine pointing at your phone in an empty living room right and AI instantly suggests furniture that fits in your space and style that's really cool it's a very good use case then with Vision Pro or Quest 3 you can walk around your new virtual uh couch get to see the color of it feel it it's so cool and returns are down 40% because people actually know what exactly they are getting this really is the future of shopping and the future of technology bringing merging these interactions together for customers here are some learning resources if you want to learn more about VR AR all of the above one is Unity learn XR development path another is Apple Vision Pro development course this is a really good one in my opinion and another is meta's presence platform tutorials they have a ton there so why does this matter I mean when you really think about it well one Apple's Vision Pro launch showed us that spatial Computing is the next Computing platform companies like Walmart BMW are all using it for training and design and this brings us to our fourth Point our fourth technology to learn this is fascinating this one which is Edge aai in tiny machine learning you see this tiny chip it can run AI models that used to need an entire server room that Edge Ai and it's changing everything I know I say that for all these Technologies but they truly are everything from SmartWatches to factory robots but here's what really blew my mind here's a real world example of it John Deere the Tractor Company put AI into tractors that's smarter than most computers from 5 years ago these tractors can then Spot crop diseases instantly work without internet and process a terabyte of field data daily that's like streaming 200 HD movies all while farming and the result is 30% less pesticide was used that's not just good for Farms it's also good for all of us Edge Computing really is starting to make quite a bit of waves in technology and in this space and I think it's going to be a huge area a huge potential place for you to grow your career so here are some learning resources one is Edge impulse Foundation course another is Tiny ml specialization on corsera corera has Great Courses and a third is Google's tensor flow light tutorials and this matters so much because by 2025 there will be over 7 billion iot devices each one needs AI that can run constant and efficiently with Cloud connection sorry I had to really think there because that the stats are just wild they're really incredible Edge Computing that's another area you need to get into or at least understand okay we made it to number five which is Advanced llm operations you know there had to be a bit more AI in here all right remember when everyone was talking about chat GPT well well as we all know now that was just the beginning the real Revolution is in customizing these models for specific tasks here's a real world example of this the Mayo Clinic built an AI assistant that is transforming Healthcare it helps doctors write patient summaries suggest treatments based on medical history and has cut documentation time almost in half but here's what makes it really special it's custom trained on their medical records and uses rag to always stay accurate this isn't General AI it's AI that's becoming a specialized as doctors using it here are some good resources one is anthropics developer documentation they have great documentation for you to start building with anothers open ai's fine-tuning course hugging faces llm engineering course and there are so many other ones out there this is a really great opportunity you didn't miss the wave for AI it's just continuing to evolve really understanding how customize or how to even use and deploy customize llms will be as important as knowing how to code it's really changing everything and here's what's really exciting these are the Technologies of the future so if you are interested in taking your career to the next level making you be able to stand out on your resume or just curious about what to maybe you're a forever learner like me and just want to spend a lot of your time learning these are where you should be spending your time I am so excited for the future and it's moving so quickly that the things we will see in our lifetime it's going to get wild make sure to hit that subscribe button let me know if you like these styles of videos where we dive into not only the top Technologies or top things to learn but also real world examples as to why they are so impactful and then share courses that you can directly start learning from all right I will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]

then you switch to there go for 5 years for 5 years I was pretty early to join there uh 2018 f is when I joined and left in 2022 importantly how a company transitions well by the time we could react you already a billion dollar you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes right now as of today you I I don't know what playes in the future but as of today I have on a mission to solve one of the hardest problems in computer science so you cannot laugh you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you able to make talking about appraisals and promotions I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact thr it grow but like Tech is very rewarding the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro it is just the time spent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected 6.5 and that thing hurts me because all right hi everyone and welcome to a new podcast today we have arpit arpit how's it going all going good yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me thank you for traveling so far uh arpit was here to meet the super 30 folks for the people who don't know arpit has had an interesting journey we'll talk about it uh but recently he was telling me currently he's trying out a startup if it doesn't work out his plan is to go back to Google as a principal if it doesn't work out his plan sees to go to any company in India because all of his students are staff engineers at various companies in India that's the kind of person you're talking to there's this pyramid analogy that he gave a while back uh this isn't the pyramid this is the pyramid it's extremely flat by which I mean there a lot of people at the bottom but staff level principal level L it's really hard to find the right people he was telling me there's this opening in Google open for eight months so I'm going to call this the pyramid talk understanding how can you grow up the pyramid sd1 level or you know pressure level how do you stay the middle of the pyramid to make sure you don't get filtered out as you grow up with that arpit yeah thanks for thank for summarizing it but one change it's not fallback is not principal engineer engineer but the fallback is Staff engineer at Google but everything else is true 100% it's definitely much more tapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's not extremely tapered it's very flat at top right so yeah very few good people at the top perfect soit would love to know your journey from the starting when did you join College I joined in 2008 and uh graduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013 to5 okay and what were your colleges my uh graduation College was College of Engineering Pune and my masters was from triple Hyderabad all right very cool oh Tri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a good college very good one of the best outs you in the country yeah so did you feel that difference between bachelors and Masters so fortunately my graduation College was also good uh it is maharashtra's best college uh the kind of exposure I got during my college time was invaluable both during my graduation and during my masters the one change or another two key things that changed during my masters was number one uh the importance of coding culture which I did not have in my graduation college and the and the second thing was the importance of research culture which again was lacking in my btech college so that exposure was really nice uh unfortunately a lot of people who do Masters in India do it for placement purposes so the crowd had some like the core motivation of crowd was different the core motivation of crowding my B College was different but people who wanted to leverage the way they would want they have leveraged the Master's beautiful and the graduation beautifully but the difference is is there my B and master col all right would you say that was worth it going for a masters spending three years uh if you do your Masters within 3 years yes after 3 years no okay because it's not worth it given if like if your soul a is to get a job or let's say go to us or something it's better to crack and then do an internal switch without you losing your salary or having the 2-year career break you can uh reach to the position where you want to but if you think that or or other your motivation is to go deeper into your subjects deeper into your domain and whatnot Master is really good uh but you have to be very clear with your goal because you know there will be people having placement I have job job job internship internship internship placement placement placement but then if you look at them and then you decide that such you could have done job and then made an internal switch to a different country or different company and whatnot right so in my case my intention was to first of all get a good brand on my resum I be brutally honest second was to uh because what happened is after my graduation um I was working for a company called Sapa softwares my wife my then girlfriend now wife worked at basically Delhi MC M Bangalore and I applied and uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected and the offered 6.5 oh and that thing hurts me because it was not the disparity it was basically the parity that happened because of my college of graduation I was under assumption mra's best college but no one in Bangalore knew that and that hit me hard I also bang at that time and they not my resume and I realized and that was the thinging hey I need a good brand on my resume and I still need to pursue my passion for engineering which is where uped for gate and joined trip Hyderabad because they have their own entrance exam I did like 500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 something I was getting it g at that time I go at that time but then I chose to appear for triple it exam cracked it and then joined that college and then made the most I could two years right on very cool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch 2012 Masters 2015 all right I would assume after 2015 your fresher Journey started again I was a associate software engineer at D that's how it started yeah all right oh so your first offer was deaw yeah and I it in a month and a half in in a month and a half yeah interesting yeah I'm too quick to judge what was what was what did you not like about Finance no it was not about domain it was about the work that I was doing okay like even if I imagine you doing your Masters and then writing web Scrappers not so I was part of front office part of oil Natural Gas and energy sector so my job my job and my tech lead's job also was to scrape energy websites get the latest prices and then inest it in the database for Brokers to use right like no not going to happen not going to do this for like 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life I immediately made a switch to pra and pror was aggressively hiring I a lot of people from trip went toor right right right and then I joined devop and then life took care of itself you said in practce you started to devops yeah oh super interesting so okay I would love to know more about this so you uh I would assume in college how much devops did you do zero zero I did not even know how server what is a server how it starts what is a web server how it connect I have no idea I just learned it on the go I go it so prao was a startup back then I was very fast Peak at the 2015 2016 got it so how did you learn on the job how did you make your learning curve so high while you were there so to be honest in for me what the fuel was simple that although I graduated in 2012 I was still a fresher in 2015 so effectively I did my btech for seven years right right so I had to make up right for because I was not making any money at that time one year I job one year of job I did I put it in my mtech fees so I had to cover up because my batches were already senior software engineers and some of them were teches so I had to over compensate and because I had to over compensate I'll go all in worked really hard made an impact got my first promotion in 6 months so I was one of the two or three freshers who got promoted out of batch of 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired and two or three got promoted I was one of them me a Bazar Raja I remember three of us definitely who got promoted at that time and and confidence although the doain was entirely new but I still did it and one of the key highlights that was there was how although I was part of devops I was also part of an internal JavaScript regulation team I had no idea of JavaScript but my first principle thinking my thought process my attitude uh I built internal portals and whatnot at that time react was just picking up and I started learning it it's fun although it's not supposed to be done by a devop but I was still doing it and seeing that I was part of a internal team for JS Guild where we like one F from each team like we were like seven eight people team who were regulating JavaScript usage in the organization that hey which packages should you use will do the vulnerability checking this that everybody will download package from the same Source not from the standard npm right and whatnot got it so the great thing was I never said throughout my experience and then I started climbing up ladder much faster because of that very cool uh do you remember any experiences of I don't know good things that you saw at prao good challenges that you got introduced to U considering the scale of the company back then yeah so at prao um I was handling entire infrastructure so I was handling uh Dev infrastructure and in the later half of my uh sprinted PR I was Al handling a bit of production so one of the key things that I learned there was how to manage elastic search cluster so pract did not use a managed offering used to run elastic search cluster on ec2 instances at that time so what I had to do was I learned it first and then applied it that how do you Ure how do you handle Hot Shot problem what if one of The Shard is becoming piping H because of all the load that is coming in how do you solve it how do you balance and all those Concepts that I learned while managing my own cluster that helps it still helps me when I am doing database migration and I'm doing anything else because the underlying Concepts exactly the same that is one very cool uh and you worked at pror for two years one and a half year one and a half year what was your next switch that was Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay so Finance to Startup toig and then I moved to so Amazon Hyderabad was there I was part of team called Fast data Technologies so fast data so we used to take care of cold tearing of hot data so let's say their main database is transactional database let's say hypothetical example it's MyQ it was not my SQL but let's take example of my SQL is a hot storage now what we used to do was we used to take data out and move it to a cold tier which is S3 okay more important it's not Arch most people think I moving data to S3 it's archive it's not archive i have to seamlessly be able to query across the data right be it hot TI be it cold tier okay we do this to say cost mhm so we were one of the largest customers of S3 like my small team was one of the largest customers of S3 like we were competing directly with Netflix with respect to the amount of data we save oh wow so that's the scale of Amazon and I just learned it while it was there what it takes to do this and whatnot so we used to run job jobs that used to download that used to extract the data transform it a bit create M database store it on S3 and more importantly not losing an ability to query the data you could see this in example as if you use Amazon app uh you go to orders page and you see your past orders the most recent six month orders come from hot storage when you do it change it and like that was literally our customer okay so when you change it uh before 6 months that all comes from S3 all right so that is the hot storage and Cold Storage uh that we did at that time very cool how how are you querying from S3 directly how would you run so that's the thing so that is where you have to store your data in a way that you have indexes on your ec2 instances because you still have to query it you will not be storing the data on E2 ins you'll be storing indexes on E2 ins kind of and then uh when you make a request it comes to a central router that router checks the hot storage if it has the data it Serv it if not it comes to Cold Storage Cold Storage is one of the servers that server has the data great it serves it if not goes through SD gets the data caches it for some time and then serves it so but that when you're doing this on S3 it's not you can think of it as nine implementation is one file for each order M but then you would have so many files correct which is just impractical so which is where you have to create a bunch of embedded databases where you store this key value store in a efficient format and that small index is loaded here so that you still know where to go and read the data and then serve it so without losing an ability to query the data on S3 so we have we did pointed reads of a fraction of data within a file on S3 all right so you save a ton of money that scale of Amazon Super same all right oh that's Prett cool so saying most data that's archival in Amazon things like past orders some of it comes from hot storage a lot of it is S3 I would assume most of it a lot majority of them is because you're very likely to query your most recent order yeah and not so likely to query your older order so all of that comes from us very cool uh so this was your work at Amazon any other interesting project you worked on Amazon was this all right then you switch to there go for five years for five years five years yeah okay I was pretty to join there uh 2018 FB is when I joined and left in 2022 2018 FB so what were your what number employee were you on in the tech team my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow it went like a it like a dummy ID when I used to say this everybody used Tock right so my employ C was 123 I was mostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Tech oh wow very early so I started I started handling search okay there buil entire search ground up uh then looked at then while I was mentoring back end folks here and there doing Cod reviews I was a senior most person in the at that time oh so a lot of stuff uh had to be handled and all quite fun time um then I joined as a technical architect there uh slightly loaded title Butch architect I got and I was mentoring backend people I was handling search search a bit of gamification and uh mentorship optimization datab optimization and all but a lot of my energy was on search then I built notification center Ina notification center uh Pura and then I transition into leadership role okay into eing management then I built search sorry then I built s team ground up again my dev's experience at pror helped me and I buil entire team count up and then I took also took care of data engineering team five years passed gradu move to Google nice good times unacademy was my best experience so far okay undoubtedly when it comes to people learning job what what was the best part about unacademy working there to be honest it sound cringy but yeah everything because uh it never felt like it was someone else's company I never felt like an employee never always took but deep inside I knew how much I cared for the product how much I car for the company to win so I still remember every Friday s used to go down me and my friend becauseas we used to work and come and make it uh make it up and rning again while Tech we used to have game nights every Friday and every Friday while that game night was happening the search used to go down because of the peak traffic that we used to get right and then we sat once and for all so yeah people were amazing uh Tech was very nice I learned a lot of hacks there that um and since then I've been saying this um what matters is business product and then engineering engineering is always an unbl right nobody cares about a solid principle liquid principle gas principle if your business is not surviving cor or if your business is not driving you don't have a good product so I understood the importance of that and more importantly how company transitions no from a very small company a little startup and then when venture capital is infused and a huge venture capital is infused what it takes for you to operate at massive scale well by the time we could react we were already a billion dollar and then so many [Music] people so much of stuff that were happening that it was becoming difficult more difficult by the day to manage it but then that was my learning thing let's build deep ground up now already has an experience come an em and build a team right and so on so for so it was very nice combination uh but again the curse of becoming bigger prior like things we used to say now becomes official Gade and that is something that we did not like it much like all the old folks we like better off we would do it right so a lot of those things scpt up but that was a good learning that you understand how a company Transitions and you have to adapt to it you cannot just say it anything will still be chaotic right at that skill you have to have those processes if you don't have processes you know what all things can go wrong so that was very good uh learning not just from coding coding side but also from what it takes to build a team scal team importance of processes um setting up right processes security practices zero trust on employees so that was very nice very cool uh yeah I lot to talk about your journey there considering I'm assuming when you joined the devop pipeline was very janky and by the time you left I would assume since it was a company you know everything was stable as you said employee management things like these Journey first I'm assuming you L it an academ is also one product this is when you open any Tex page yeah when it comes to the front end when it comes to their you know if you've seen their live video you've probably seen it never seen a better one everyone else uses Zoom unacademy has its own live true so would love to know I don't know about the product was great one of the best products the secret source of an academy was the passion of people the people who are building it never again I I again repeat he we all never felt it was someone else's company we all were very proud of what we were building so first years was like the best for us we never thought we built video calling for educator payments part unacademy subscription was when we were there like entire business model changing we saw impact of business model nobody had done subscriptions in N Tech anad was the first one to subscriptions in Tech right so that was fa and because we were so engrossed with the vision and we felt our vision plus we had some very amazing designers and all they the found then gave then the business sorry then the product design guidelines were so in place that everybody stuck to what was part of the uh guidelines and all and it was very well taught so him kov both are extremely focused on on Crafting great user experience and that is shown through and through produ development life cycle engineering was our passion busing then we also we Cann make cor it very cool uh do you can you talk about the infrastructure at unacademy finally by the time you left or is that IND infrastructure is it what inra size of infra where did you guys deployed what cloud what technology it was all AWS all AWS we already have blocks I'm not spilling the VIN here it's all out there we were on AWS uh completely on AWS we had uh almost no plans of moving out because of the tight coupling of our services deployment Frameworks and what not with AWS and and that was primarily our infra um multi- region yes uh Singapore was our primary monolithic region and live classes were driven from Mumbai okay because when an academy started Mumbai data center wasn't there right so that's why all the services all the backend Services were in uh Singapore got it while live classes because of minimizing latency were all in Mumbai these were like key different key difference uh sizing and all was above average than most companies in India U we are playing a pretty hefty amount to AWS as our monthly bill which was pretty interesting I never thought but that was that was a big learning and more importantly that when you have this big of an infra it's one of my biggest St was it's not the matter of what goes wrong it's matter of where it goes [Music] wrong yeah if you assume let's say one in one year goes down one time on average so when you have a massive infra it's not the matter of what it's matter of when when it will go down and you have to be prepared for things going wrong things shutting down abruptly um one of the most interesting challenges we used to get and we used to shout at AWS for this is their EVS volume so there so we use RDS to host the database and then EBS volume used to keep flipping right and it used to keep crashing and then it it used to lead to our realiz that because of the size of infrastructure it's bound to happen and you have to be ready with that right like what do you do to make sure that you are not impacted much right so interest all right so not F face challenges AWS is not able to handle our load yet or our bandwidth yet it was actually not AWS is not able to handle it's like it could be because AWS is pretty vast and our traffic is not as much as like I was giving an example of what we did at what I did at Amazon the thing is that you cannot consider your infrastructure to be always up and running correct when your infra size is large things going down is much more C you cannot think of it as an exceptional event it's not exception it's a normal you have to be okay with that so that was our biggest learning thing being prepared for things going wrong having a fall back having a right that we had to ensure across all of our services also that was pretty interesting and challenging very cool cool U 5 years at an academy then Google back to Big Tech back to Big yeah big Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah I joined Google I was uh India for data Pro Data proess managed EOS system man SP what actually unfortunately fortunately people have AWS in so gcp equalent of that is data right so I was part of performance uh gcp data performance so we used to take care of uh making sure that Apaches Park that we run runs the best on gcp so we used to manipulate Apaches those Vari of apach spark add our patches to it and make it hyper optimized to run on gcp workloads all right so this way our customers get best service we don't use things out of the box from open source right we optimize it for uh our Hardware our infrastructure and then pass on the benefits to the customers so I was IND for data all right had you worked on similar problems before never so I I have to learn on the even at I was doing search I never worked on search at practor I worked on devops I never work I never started a server right then at Amazon I was doing colding of big data I never worked on that uh an academy search never worked on notification never worked on feed but again for me it was plus I never managed a team I never built a team from ground up uh never did inra rotation so there are a lot of things that were new almost always but having that right to learn what's so tough in it nothing tough like you just have to put in the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro in it it's just the time spent in that doain that's the only difference I agree if I spend enough time same time as that person I would be able to know the same things the same set of things maybe even better right maybe even more than what that person knows so with that it was easier for me to like that was the mindset that I I've always operated on right makes sense that that leads to two questions U one is how was your interview process at these companies considering yeah that's the first question so one thing I realize is it's all about how you communicate during intervie how how strong is your conviction H now most people they fear or they're intimidated by oh my God this is something new I will not be able to do it but if you showcase a high conviction in my case because of my personality because of my slightly Ecentric personality I'm able to radiate confidence better I'm able to speak better so it's about if I have high conviction that I'll figure it out M then the hiring manager also has a high conviction all okay and the inter process is almost always like they judge you on your problem solving skills and this and that if you're able to articulate your thoughts well you're able to solve the problems that have been asked in the interview you'll 100% be able to uh crack the inter definitely Stu is going there and making an impact that takes time so you cannot Bluff you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you are able to make an impact after you join right so you cannot lie over here so your conviction needs to be high but backed by your past achievements right it cannot be like any not to up then you lose your job right so this is something that I always tell people that you should radiate confidence you should have High conviction in your abilities but it should be backed by your past data right been there done that for and whatnot with Awards recognitions impact output outcome some and uh interview process mostly this and they see how Keen you are into solving this problem most people are not keen tackling the new new challenge most I I worked on search I'll solve search I worked on this I done this now imagine how many people in India or even in the world would be there who are working on open source Apaches part and optimizing its performance you cannot expect this kind of work to be like you cannot expect to find people who have done similar work right right right right possible prodop you can still find people with similar experience for this obscure type thing it's incredibly difficult which is where your first principle thinking right your at to solve problems and all of that K in so interview difference is more about you showing your faith and them reciprocating in the right s and again it's their responsibility to evaluate better right if they have made a bad call hiring me for example they would change their interess right either I either I or they learn yeah the second question here is will very relevant for people people get very over with the new technology so you know I think if I ask most people here they'll be like they're going to judge me on impact so how do you think you did that how do you think that is the thought process of people I think people don't generally like computer science most of them said everybody has an inclination right but why do you think people have that attitude I think it's more like they confident in cracking interviews because it's cracking an interview is sort of rigged right at some point it's it's like preparing examination yeah you always Tau to prepare well for examination and that's end of story exactly you never told that's a situation so most people one I realiz is we are all taught to study a fixed syllabus M crack an exam join a college or join a job what people feel in college exact same thing they feel at job okay how do I differentiate yeah how do I crack marks how do I do this college m still is there also you have like different examinations to crack marks soob people try to manipulate or they try to have this as de [Music] they draw right right right so everything so which is why bu for the problem it's in two parts first is startups and second is Big Tech right now big Tech process is very uh strategized it's very form you exactly know okay these five things I'm supposed to do and this is the rating I would get right so that's why good students always do well at Big because they exactly know what they Ching you have to have you have to be owner of at least one service you have to drive business impact of at least one if it's not written then manager would tell them because manager people are because manager is also chasing some goals correct correct so good students do very well at Big Texs you there is a structure right there is a checklist that you are following exactly very similar to your checklist during your college days and during your exam preparation phas but things become very interesting when it's a startup when it's ambiguous when manager know and priorties keep shifting and this and that this is where people will find the hardest and to be honest more people work in these type of companies than big Tech correct correct so which is why most people find it hard so one thing I always tell key it does not matter the the lines of quote that you have shipped what is stable is it driving the impact it is supposed to because I've known I've known a person who has built three killer features but none of them worked guess if that person would have gotten a promotion or not I would assume no no again was that person's fault no but it was a collective failure of for examp you're there you win your team wins you cannot say because your the outcome see output is in your control outcome is not in your exactly outcome is a collective effort it's Collective effort of entire Team Management leadership business marketing everything right so whatever is in your control you do your best and then because in my case also there have been two products that have been completely scraped after I work on it for 8 months did I whine about it I feel bad but then I had to make sure that I am having enough other impactful stuff right and people need to understand and people find it difficult because they are amb envirment they don't find it right so having an ability to spot he this is impactful or this is the bare minimum efforts I would drive the max impact and I could go above and beyond here is important I'll give a simple example like Extreme Concrete example is um let's say I know my project is going nowhere now what should what should I do I know that this project is doomed to fail and I know I would not be getting a promotion what should you do one okay here are ideas you talk to your manager manager probably manag you are being so p you are seeing it your manager is not seeing it exactly so that that part is closed second is I would just make sure have some other impact that I can show but then manag would say your your entire should be here yeah third option is you try to improve your visibility in the same time right company TI talk though ah okay help other people Mentor few folks make help others will you are collecting your browny points this is at one point this is literally what I did really okay I would assum at Pig Tech not start up start so because if you see that something might not work you have to start working on your plan B much sooner right right without telling other people that this is my plan right and without you showcasing your disinterest or your pism because if you show your pessimism people working with you will become negative yeah you should be very this that and what without putting yourself in bad books you have to still drive in back because obious Seasons because this project is important for organization so you start working on Parallel things right at least because then you that you could not have done if you were busy if this was impactful very high focus you could not have done that right so use that time to drive other things and that's how you still make sure that throughout your Span in your organization wherever you are working you have something impactful every month coming out right it may be your direct work it may be your indirect work through mentorship and all it could be your visibility thing it could be your influence it could be your new process that you have introduced so you have to make sure that you are making you're delivering enough impact right in one year talking about appraisals and promotions so I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact show it grow um but like Tech is very rewarding um even if you're working you know in India only us it's very reporting even in India so what do you think if someone is you know growing up the pyramid correctly paying their debts doing everything right and growing up to the pyramid how much money can they retire with in India uh you know humbly if they're working not taking any random bets they weren't early at zato and that IPO they w at a Google and Amazon um you know paid their debts so typically salaries based salaries would cap software around 1C even for a descent if you take that as ceiling 1C is a ceiling that someone would hit uh to one CR for 5 years would be almost negligible expenses and all so roughly five to six like would end up making a million dollars right 7 to8 CR on a above average basis right right so if you're investing right and if you're you know just doing a job and I would assume there are stocks on top yeah so if you add that up um by the time you retire you're probably pretty comfortable yeah most people would be extremely comfortable you just need one big Tech experience or a well-known startup experience in your resume within first 7 to 8 years okay then it's a smooth sailing after that go then even if you do average or above average at least you'll get interview you keep making you'll keep consistently making that bare minimum amount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till 4045 in Tech got and last question let's talk about what you're doing right now so you left Google 6 months ago I left in January it's almost 11 months now 10 months now January 6th I left Google oh God so the clock is scking you told me in a year you can join Google back in a year yeah without an interview yeah clock is scking um what I'm up to is uh I I left Google to start a different company with Krishna I built uh I I started with d which was supposed to be LinkedIn for people in Tech I realized AI is coming people are copy pasting from chat GPT this is not going to work so then we pivoted into profile building and then we pivoted into interviews I don't relate much with interviews so that's why I Ste down I'm still playing a technical adviser role for them MH and then I had a side project dice DB it started as a redis replacement uh two and a half years back and now I've reignited that project again reuven he I got a unique Insight after studying papers 6 months straight every single weekend going through so many databases Source Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress a bit of it and then got that one unique Insight he this is one unique Insight that no other database in the world has literally no other database and this is one audacious problem that I want to solve right so right now now as of today I don't know what lies in the future but as of today I on a mission to solve one of the hardest problem in computer science sounds fancy I'm I'm a sales person now so there are two hard things in computer science naming things and cash inv validation we want to make second one OB okay so that's the Mission Vision we are chasing MH and uh we will be a super cach um our hypothesis is today every single microservice has its own transactional DV and has its own cach correct we don't want like each micros service having a trans DP makes sense because that's a source of Truth correct but what we hypothesize is that cash should be common across all services the reason is that if I want to if one service wants to access cash data of another service they should be able to directly access it rather than them stitching another data pipeline to replicate the more most recent changes here corre it should happen directly right so that's a fundamental shift in architecture we bringing from a m topology to a star topology where everybody talks to this and this will be horizontally scalable sharded bed all the buzz words that you can think of right it's right here all right and yeah that's what I'm on it's a fun problem to very cool um one last question I will ask so this specific project now you you're building almost database or a cache as you mentioned uh how did you gain enough knowledge and insights to be able to do that and now your answer is going to be read through code bases but how does something else okay tell me the answer is not through Cod the answer is learning on the go okay so again most people operate like that perfectionist in reality they are not right right right they want I'll read Sudan I'll read this five books and this 15 books and this blog and this thing and then I'll start building it you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes and then figuring out things on the go and it's a very cliche thing but and now I'm an entrepreneur and I feel it it's literally like jumping off the airplane and then you're stitching your parachute on while you are jumping right right while you are falling down and you are being scared every two months we change our vision of figure out something so you have to have that Knack of solving problem and like for example I never implemented right ahead l in my life but I had to do it so I went through open figure out what it does how it does wrote the code understood performance Chang it and then implemented so you being able to figure out the figure out t [Music] and this is true for almost all fields and all all domains and common all entrepreneurs but especially for engineering folks this is must this is not just for entrepreneurship but even for you know when you are working having an ability to Knack interesting challenges or interesting Solutions or hacks and all are in a more situation my been learning what the wor will be it will be not perform right for then it's it later just make sure that the code is extensible your code is plugable let say the volum interpretation I was talking about I wrote an abstract wall that does ball across sqlite also and across up and file also supp up and only file is not perform and I figure out another I just have to implement those three methods correct and then so being aware that what you are writing might not be most performant and being and making your code flexible enough to accommodate fut maybe let's say let's say 20x okay and I might not be able to take it to 50x ever right but if this product does well and I hire a person whose job is to optimize it can take it to 100 correct right need production everything Cod is not right that's the best part of our right you can always Circle back and change the things and all so that's the attitude and that's the difference is what I felt a lot of people are they they are self constrained it's not you start writing code you realize how easy it is correct exactly if you don't write code you always think it's very difficult yep I I agree 100% I think the practically start well guys lastly is great at giving challenges you have a challenge for the audience some random question that you know there's a quirky answer to I have a very interesting question let's see again folks who are watching this it's a very it's a very qu question the question is um you have to write off you have to you don't have to write a function you have to write the signature of a sorting function okay the function Declaration of a sorting function function you can pass array also link list also okay but you don't know if it's are or link list okay okay so in the function body you cannot have an if if AR do this if link list do this you cannot do that okay you have to write the signature of the function such that you pass it an AR it will sort it you pass it in link you pass in a link list it will s I just want signature of the function I don't even want the function the function implementation some level of overriding uh things like equal to imagine no it's C language nor okay list is a specific data structure we have created and in any way you would pass both of them as pointers actually you acting a void start correct correct it could be an err pointer it could be this what would be your function signature and if possible as an extension what would your implementation then without and your Cod should not have if this do this if this do this right so day day I have I have an idea but stop you have anything else for the audience anything you want to share last parting thoughts parting thoughts be curious yeah have right attitude most people uh stop being curious nobody should stop being curious I very childlike uh a lot of people don't take me seriously because of that and it's totally fine so long as I'm not losing the smile on my face I'm happy I'm making money and that's what matters but one thing that has helped me reach where I have reached is because of my curiosity and high bias for Action right because curios but if you're not acting on so a lot of people have started losing their cuity and I'm seeing that happening so just want to reinstate that fact cu the do is beautiful fall in love with her do and just dig deeper it's the best thing amazing with that I hope to see some of you at the top of the pyramid I'll see you guys in the next one bye-bye thanks thank that's why you need compar that's syst so if it's you don't need a compar you know that but you need to know how to access data now follow question the function that you're passing in is how you e the right and you know Cas of list the element I need need to be element right below it before it the thing is you don't care about complex here the key thing was abstraction like how we thinking of abstraction like finding the things which are different and then abstracting them out to either passing off a function or passing an argument or something Have function so it's add could be anything basically so three functions abstractor slapping index and 15 20 minutes able to and he knew that I was going to figure it out so they as me I this question Stay With Me Something I was always like you never anticipate questions [Applause] [Music]

then you switch to there go for 5 years for 5 years I was pretty early to join there uh 2018 f is when I joined and left in 2022 importantly how a company transitions well by the time we could react you already a billion dollar you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes right now as of today you I I don't know what playes in the future but as of today I have on a mission to solve one of the hardest problems in computer science so you cannot laugh you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you able to make talking about appraisals and promotions I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact thr it grow but like Tech is very rewarding the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro it is just the time spent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected 6.5 and that thing hurts me because all right hi everyone and welcome to a new podcast today we have arpit arpit how's it going all going good yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me thank you for traveling so far uh arpit was here to meet the super 30 folks for the people who don't know arpit has had an interesting journey we'll talk about it uh but recently he was telling me currently he's trying out a startup if it doesn't work out his plan is to go back to Google as a principal if it doesn't work out his plan sees to go to any company in India because all of his students are staff engineers at various companies in India that's the kind of person you're talking to there's this pyramid analogy that he gave a while back uh this isn't the pyramid this is the pyramid it's extremely flat by which I mean there a lot of people at the bottom but staff level principal level L it's really hard to find the right people he was telling me there's this opening in Google open for eight months so I'm going to call this the pyramid talk understanding how can you grow up the pyramid sd1 level or you know pressure level how do you stay the middle of the pyramid to make sure you don't get filtered out as you grow up with that arpit yeah thanks for thank for summarizing it but one change it's not fallback is not principal engineer engineer but the fallback is Staff engineer at Google but everything else is true 100% it's definitely much more tapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's not extremely tapered it's very flat at top right so yeah very few good people at the top perfect soit would love to know your journey from the starting when did you join College I joined in 2008 and uh graduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013 to5 okay and what were your colleges my uh graduation College was College of Engineering Pune and my masters was from triple Hyderabad all right very cool oh Tri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a good college very good one of the best outs you in the country yeah so did you feel that difference between bachelors and Masters so fortunately my graduation College was also good uh it is maharashtra's best college uh the kind of exposure I got during my college time was invaluable both during my graduation and during my masters the one change or another two key things that changed during my masters was number one uh the importance of coding culture which I did not have in my graduation college and the and the second thing was the importance of research culture which again was lacking in my btech college so that exposure was really nice uh unfortunately a lot of people who do Masters in India do it for placement purposes so the crowd had some like the core motivation of crowd was different the core motivation of crowding my B College was different but people who wanted to leverage the way they would want they have leveraged the Master's beautiful and the graduation beautifully but the difference is is there my B and master col all right would you say that was worth it going for a masters spending three years uh if you do your Masters within 3 years yes after 3 years no okay because it's not worth it given if like if your soul a is to get a job or let's say go to us or something it's better to crack and then do an internal switch without you losing your salary or having the 2-year career break you can uh reach to the position where you want to but if you think that or or other your motivation is to go deeper into your subjects deeper into your domain and whatnot Master is really good uh but you have to be very clear with your goal because you know there will be people having placement I have job job job internship internship internship placement placement placement but then if you look at them and then you decide that such you could have done job and then made an internal switch to a different country or different company and whatnot right so in my case my intention was to first of all get a good brand on my resum I be brutally honest second was to uh because what happened is after my graduation um I was working for a company called Sapa softwares my wife my then girlfriend now wife worked at basically Delhi MC M Bangalore and I applied and uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected and the offered 6.5 oh and that thing hurts me because it was not the disparity it was basically the parity that happened because of my college of graduation I was under assumption mra's best college but no one in Bangalore knew that and that hit me hard I also bang at that time and they not my resume and I realized and that was the thinging hey I need a good brand on my resume and I still need to pursue my passion for engineering which is where uped for gate and joined trip Hyderabad because they have their own entrance exam I did like 500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 something I was getting it g at that time I go at that time but then I chose to appear for triple it exam cracked it and then joined that college and then made the most I could two years right on very cool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch 2012 Masters 2015 all right I would assume after 2015 your fresher Journey started again I was a associate software engineer at D that's how it started yeah all right oh so your first offer was deaw yeah and I it in a month and a half in in a month and a half yeah interesting yeah I'm too quick to judge what was what was what did you not like about Finance no it was not about domain it was about the work that I was doing okay like even if I imagine you doing your Masters and then writing web Scrappers not so I was part of front office part of oil Natural Gas and energy sector so my job my job and my tech lead's job also was to scrape energy websites get the latest prices and then inest it in the database for Brokers to use right like no not going to happen not going to do this for like 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life I immediately made a switch to pra and pror was aggressively hiring I a lot of people from trip went toor right right right and then I joined devop and then life took care of itself you said in practce you started to devops yeah oh super interesting so okay I would love to know more about this so you uh I would assume in college how much devops did you do zero zero I did not even know how server what is a server how it starts what is a web server how it connect I have no idea I just learned it on the go I go it so prao was a startup back then I was very fast Peak at the 2015 2016 got it so how did you learn on the job how did you make your learning curve so high while you were there so to be honest in for me what the fuel was simple that although I graduated in 2012 I was still a fresher in 2015 so effectively I did my btech for seven years right right so I had to make up right for because I was not making any money at that time one year I job one year of job I did I put it in my mtech fees so I had to cover up because my batches were already senior software engineers and some of them were teches so I had to over compensate and because I had to over compensate I'll go all in worked really hard made an impact got my first promotion in 6 months so I was one of the two or three freshers who got promoted out of batch of 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired and two or three got promoted I was one of them me a Bazar Raja I remember three of us definitely who got promoted at that time and and confidence although the doain was entirely new but I still did it and one of the key highlights that was there was how although I was part of devops I was also part of an internal JavaScript regulation team I had no idea of JavaScript but my first principle thinking my thought process my attitude uh I built internal portals and whatnot at that time react was just picking up and I started learning it it's fun although it's not supposed to be done by a devop but I was still doing it and seeing that I was part of a internal team for JS Guild where we like one F from each team like we were like seven eight people team who were regulating JavaScript usage in the organization that hey which packages should you use will do the vulnerability checking this that everybody will download package from the same Source not from the standard npm right and whatnot got it so the great thing was I never said throughout my experience and then I started climbing up ladder much faster because of that very cool uh do you remember any experiences of I don't know good things that you saw at prao good challenges that you got introduced to U considering the scale of the company back then yeah so at prao um I was handling entire infrastructure so I was handling uh Dev infrastructure and in the later half of my uh sprinted PR I was Al handling a bit of production so one of the key things that I learned there was how to manage elastic search cluster so pract did not use a managed offering used to run elastic search cluster on ec2 instances at that time so what I had to do was I learned it first and then applied it that how do you Ure how do you handle Hot Shot problem what if one of The Shard is becoming piping H because of all the load that is coming in how do you solve it how do you balance and all those Concepts that I learned while managing my own cluster that helps it still helps me when I am doing database migration and I'm doing anything else because the underlying Concepts exactly the same that is one very cool uh and you worked at pror for two years one and a half year one and a half year what was your next switch that was Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay so Finance to Startup toig and then I moved to so Amazon Hyderabad was there I was part of team called Fast data Technologies so fast data so we used to take care of cold tearing of hot data so let's say their main database is transactional database let's say hypothetical example it's MyQ it was not my SQL but let's take example of my SQL is a hot storage now what we used to do was we used to take data out and move it to a cold tier which is S3 okay more important it's not Arch most people think I moving data to S3 it's archive it's not archive i have to seamlessly be able to query across the data right be it hot TI be it cold tier okay we do this to say cost mhm so we were one of the largest customers of S3 like my small team was one of the largest customers of S3 like we were competing directly with Netflix with respect to the amount of data we save oh wow so that's the scale of Amazon and I just learned it while it was there what it takes to do this and whatnot so we used to run job jobs that used to download that used to extract the data transform it a bit create M database store it on S3 and more importantly not losing an ability to query the data you could see this in example as if you use Amazon app uh you go to orders page and you see your past orders the most recent six month orders come from hot storage when you do it change it and like that was literally our customer okay so when you change it uh before 6 months that all comes from S3 all right so that is the hot storage and Cold Storage uh that we did at that time very cool how how are you querying from S3 directly how would you run so that's the thing so that is where you have to store your data in a way that you have indexes on your ec2 instances because you still have to query it you will not be storing the data on E2 ins you'll be storing indexes on E2 ins kind of and then uh when you make a request it comes to a central router that router checks the hot storage if it has the data it Serv it if not it comes to Cold Storage Cold Storage is one of the servers that server has the data great it serves it if not goes through SD gets the data caches it for some time and then serves it so but that when you're doing this on S3 it's not you can think of it as nine implementation is one file for each order M but then you would have so many files correct which is just impractical so which is where you have to create a bunch of embedded databases where you store this key value store in a efficient format and that small index is loaded here so that you still know where to go and read the data and then serve it so without losing an ability to query the data on S3 so we have we did pointed reads of a fraction of data within a file on S3 all right so you save a ton of money that scale of Amazon Super same all right oh that's Prett cool so saying most data that's archival in Amazon things like past orders some of it comes from hot storage a lot of it is S3 I would assume most of it a lot majority of them is because you're very likely to query your most recent order yeah and not so likely to query your older order so all of that comes from us very cool uh so this was your work at Amazon any other interesting project you worked on Amazon was this all right then you switch to there go for five years for five years five years yeah okay I was pretty to join there uh 2018 FB is when I joined and left in 2022 2018 FB so what were your what number employee were you on in the tech team my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow it went like a it like a dummy ID when I used to say this everybody used Tock right so my employ C was 123 I was mostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Tech oh wow very early so I started I started handling search okay there buil entire search ground up uh then looked at then while I was mentoring back end folks here and there doing Cod reviews I was a senior most person in the at that time oh so a lot of stuff uh had to be handled and all quite fun time um then I joined as a technical architect there uh slightly loaded title Butch architect I got and I was mentoring backend people I was handling search search a bit of gamification and uh mentorship optimization datab optimization and all but a lot of my energy was on search then I built notification center Ina notification center uh Pura and then I transition into leadership role okay into eing management then I built search sorry then I built s team ground up again my dev's experience at pror helped me and I buil entire team count up and then I took also took care of data engineering team five years passed gradu move to Google nice good times unacademy was my best experience so far okay undoubtedly when it comes to people learning job what what was the best part about unacademy working there to be honest it sound cringy but yeah everything because uh it never felt like it was someone else's company I never felt like an employee never always took but deep inside I knew how much I cared for the product how much I car for the company to win so I still remember every Friday s used to go down me and my friend becauseas we used to work and come and make it uh make it up and rning again while Tech we used to have game nights every Friday and every Friday while that game night was happening the search used to go down because of the peak traffic that we used to get right and then we sat once and for all so yeah people were amazing uh Tech was very nice I learned a lot of hacks there that um and since then I've been saying this um what matters is business product and then engineering engineering is always an unbl right nobody cares about a solid principle liquid principle gas principle if your business is not surviving cor or if your business is not driving you don't have a good product so I understood the importance of that and more importantly how company transitions no from a very small company a little startup and then when venture capital is infused and a huge venture capital is infused what it takes for you to operate at massive scale well by the time we could react we were already a billion dollar and then so many [Music] people so much of stuff that were happening that it was becoming difficult more difficult by the day to manage it but then that was my learning thing let's build deep ground up now already has an experience come an em and build a team right and so on so for so it was very nice combination uh but again the curse of becoming bigger prior like things we used to say now becomes official Gade and that is something that we did not like it much like all the old folks we like better off we would do it right so a lot of those things scpt up but that was a good learning that you understand how a company Transitions and you have to adapt to it you cannot just say it anything will still be chaotic right at that skill you have to have those processes if you don't have processes you know what all things can go wrong so that was very good uh learning not just from coding coding side but also from what it takes to build a team scal team importance of processes um setting up right processes security practices zero trust on employees so that was very nice very cool uh yeah I lot to talk about your journey there considering I'm assuming when you joined the devop pipeline was very janky and by the time you left I would assume since it was a company you know everything was stable as you said employee management things like these Journey first I'm assuming you L it an academ is also one product this is when you open any Tex page yeah when it comes to the front end when it comes to their you know if you've seen their live video you've probably seen it never seen a better one everyone else uses Zoom unacademy has its own live true so would love to know I don't know about the product was great one of the best products the secret source of an academy was the passion of people the people who are building it never again I I again repeat he we all never felt it was someone else's company we all were very proud of what we were building so first years was like the best for us we never thought we built video calling for educator payments part unacademy subscription was when we were there like entire business model changing we saw impact of business model nobody had done subscriptions in N Tech anad was the first one to subscriptions in Tech right so that was fa and because we were so engrossed with the vision and we felt our vision plus we had some very amazing designers and all they the found then gave then the business sorry then the product design guidelines were so in place that everybody stuck to what was part of the uh guidelines and all and it was very well taught so him kov both are extremely focused on on Crafting great user experience and that is shown through and through produ development life cycle engineering was our passion busing then we also we Cann make cor it very cool uh do you can you talk about the infrastructure at unacademy finally by the time you left or is that IND infrastructure is it what inra size of infra where did you guys deployed what cloud what technology it was all AWS all AWS we already have blocks I'm not spilling the VIN here it's all out there we were on AWS uh completely on AWS we had uh almost no plans of moving out because of the tight coupling of our services deployment Frameworks and what not with AWS and and that was primarily our infra um multi- region yes uh Singapore was our primary monolithic region and live classes were driven from Mumbai okay because when an academy started Mumbai data center wasn't there right so that's why all the services all the backend Services were in uh Singapore got it while live classes because of minimizing latency were all in Mumbai these were like key different key difference uh sizing and all was above average than most companies in India U we are playing a pretty hefty amount to AWS as our monthly bill which was pretty interesting I never thought but that was that was a big learning and more importantly that when you have this big of an infra it's one of my biggest St was it's not the matter of what goes wrong it's matter of where it goes [Music] wrong yeah if you assume let's say one in one year goes down one time on average so when you have a massive infra it's not the matter of what it's matter of when when it will go down and you have to be prepared for things going wrong things shutting down abruptly um one of the most interesting challenges we used to get and we used to shout at AWS for this is their EVS volume so there so we use RDS to host the database and then EBS volume used to keep flipping right and it used to keep crashing and then it it used to lead to our realiz that because of the size of infrastructure it's bound to happen and you have to be ready with that right like what do you do to make sure that you are not impacted much right so interest all right so not F face challenges AWS is not able to handle our load yet or our bandwidth yet it was actually not AWS is not able to handle it's like it could be because AWS is pretty vast and our traffic is not as much as like I was giving an example of what we did at what I did at Amazon the thing is that you cannot consider your infrastructure to be always up and running correct when your infra size is large things going down is much more C you cannot think of it as an exceptional event it's not exception it's a normal you have to be okay with that so that was our biggest learning thing being prepared for things going wrong having a fall back having a right that we had to ensure across all of our services also that was pretty interesting and challenging very cool cool U 5 years at an academy then Google back to Big Tech back to Big yeah big Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah I joined Google I was uh India for data Pro Data proess managed EOS system man SP what actually unfortunately fortunately people have AWS in so gcp equalent of that is data right so I was part of performance uh gcp data performance so we used to take care of uh making sure that Apaches Park that we run runs the best on gcp so we used to manipulate Apaches those Vari of apach spark add our patches to it and make it hyper optimized to run on gcp workloads all right so this way our customers get best service we don't use things out of the box from open source right we optimize it for uh our Hardware our infrastructure and then pass on the benefits to the customers so I was IND for data all right had you worked on similar problems before never so I I have to learn on the even at I was doing search I never worked on search at practor I worked on devops I never work I never started a server right then at Amazon I was doing colding of big data I never worked on that uh an academy search never worked on notification never worked on feed but again for me it was plus I never managed a team I never built a team from ground up uh never did inra rotation so there are a lot of things that were new almost always but having that right to learn what's so tough in it nothing tough like you just have to put in the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro in it it's just the time spent in that doain that's the only difference I agree if I spend enough time same time as that person I would be able to know the same things the same set of things maybe even better right maybe even more than what that person knows so with that it was easier for me to like that was the mindset that I I've always operated on right makes sense that that leads to two questions U one is how was your interview process at these companies considering yeah that's the first question so one thing I realize is it's all about how you communicate during intervie how how strong is your conviction H now most people they fear or they're intimidated by oh my God this is something new I will not be able to do it but if you showcase a high conviction in my case because of my personality because of my slightly Ecentric personality I'm able to radiate confidence better I'm able to speak better so it's about if I have high conviction that I'll figure it out M then the hiring manager also has a high conviction all okay and the inter process is almost always like they judge you on your problem solving skills and this and that if you're able to articulate your thoughts well you're able to solve the problems that have been asked in the interview you'll 100% be able to uh crack the inter definitely Stu is going there and making an impact that takes time so you cannot Bluff you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you are able to make an impact after you join right so you cannot lie over here so your conviction needs to be high but backed by your past achievements right it cannot be like any not to up then you lose your job right so this is something that I always tell people that you should radiate confidence you should have High conviction in your abilities but it should be backed by your past data right been there done that for and whatnot with Awards recognitions impact output outcome some and uh interview process mostly this and they see how Keen you are into solving this problem most people are not keen tackling the new new challenge most I I worked on search I'll solve search I worked on this I done this now imagine how many people in India or even in the world would be there who are working on open source Apaches part and optimizing its performance you cannot expect this kind of work to be like you cannot expect to find people who have done similar work right right right right possible prodop you can still find people with similar experience for this obscure type thing it's incredibly difficult which is where your first principle thinking right your at to solve problems and all of that K in so interview difference is more about you showing your faith and them reciprocating in the right s and again it's their responsibility to evaluate better right if they have made a bad call hiring me for example they would change their interess right either I either I or they learn yeah the second question here is will very relevant for people people get very over with the new technology so you know I think if I ask most people here they'll be like they're going to judge me on impact so how do you think you did that how do you think that is the thought process of people I think people don't generally like computer science most of them said everybody has an inclination right but why do you think people have that attitude I think it's more like they confident in cracking interviews because it's cracking an interview is sort of rigged right at some point it's it's like preparing examination yeah you always Tau to prepare well for examination and that's end of story exactly you never told that's a situation so most people one I realiz is we are all taught to study a fixed syllabus M crack an exam join a college or join a job what people feel in college exact same thing they feel at job okay how do I differentiate yeah how do I crack marks how do I do this college m still is there also you have like different examinations to crack marks soob people try to manipulate or they try to have this as de [Music] they draw right right right so everything so which is why bu for the problem it's in two parts first is startups and second is Big Tech right now big Tech process is very uh strategized it's very form you exactly know okay these five things I'm supposed to do and this is the rating I would get right so that's why good students always do well at Big because they exactly know what they Ching you have to have you have to be owner of at least one service you have to drive business impact of at least one if it's not written then manager would tell them because manager people are because manager is also chasing some goals correct correct so good students do very well at Big Texs you there is a structure right there is a checklist that you are following exactly very similar to your checklist during your college days and during your exam preparation phas but things become very interesting when it's a startup when it's ambiguous when manager know and priorties keep shifting and this and that this is where people will find the hardest and to be honest more people work in these type of companies than big Tech correct correct so which is why most people find it hard so one thing I always tell key it does not matter the the lines of quote that you have shipped what is stable is it driving the impact it is supposed to because I've known I've known a person who has built three killer features but none of them worked guess if that person would have gotten a promotion or not I would assume no no again was that person's fault no but it was a collective failure of for examp you're there you win your team wins you cannot say because your the outcome see output is in your control outcome is not in your exactly outcome is a collective effort it's Collective effort of entire Team Management leadership business marketing everything right so whatever is in your control you do your best and then because in my case also there have been two products that have been completely scraped after I work on it for 8 months did I whine about it I feel bad but then I had to make sure that I am having enough other impactful stuff right and people need to understand and people find it difficult because they are amb envirment they don't find it right so having an ability to spot he this is impactful or this is the bare minimum efforts I would drive the max impact and I could go above and beyond here is important I'll give a simple example like Extreme Concrete example is um let's say I know my project is going nowhere now what should what should I do I know that this project is doomed to fail and I know I would not be getting a promotion what should you do one okay here are ideas you talk to your manager manager probably manag you are being so p you are seeing it your manager is not seeing it exactly so that that part is closed second is I would just make sure have some other impact that I can show but then manag would say your your entire should be here yeah third option is you try to improve your visibility in the same time right company TI talk though ah okay help other people Mentor few folks make help others will you are collecting your browny points this is at one point this is literally what I did really okay I would assum at Pig Tech not start up start so because if you see that something might not work you have to start working on your plan B much sooner right right without telling other people that this is my plan right and without you showcasing your disinterest or your pism because if you show your pessimism people working with you will become negative yeah you should be very this that and what without putting yourself in bad books you have to still drive in back because obious Seasons because this project is important for organization so you start working on Parallel things right at least because then you that you could not have done if you were busy if this was impactful very high focus you could not have done that right so use that time to drive other things and that's how you still make sure that throughout your Span in your organization wherever you are working you have something impactful every month coming out right it may be your direct work it may be your indirect work through mentorship and all it could be your visibility thing it could be your influence it could be your new process that you have introduced so you have to make sure that you are making you're delivering enough impact right in one year talking about appraisals and promotions so I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact show it grow um but like Tech is very rewarding um even if you're working you know in India only us it's very reporting even in India so what do you think if someone is you know growing up the pyramid correctly paying their debts doing everything right and growing up to the pyramid how much money can they retire with in India uh you know humbly if they're working not taking any random bets they weren't early at zato and that IPO they w at a Google and Amazon um you know paid their debts so typically salaries based salaries would cap software around 1C even for a descent if you take that as ceiling 1C is a ceiling that someone would hit uh to one CR for 5 years would be almost negligible expenses and all so roughly five to six like would end up making a million dollars right 7 to8 CR on a above average basis right right so if you're investing right and if you're you know just doing a job and I would assume there are stocks on top yeah so if you add that up um by the time you retire you're probably pretty comfortable yeah most people would be extremely comfortable you just need one big Tech experience or a well-known startup experience in your resume within first 7 to 8 years okay then it's a smooth sailing after that go then even if you do average or above average at least you'll get interview you keep making you'll keep consistently making that bare minimum amount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till 4045 in Tech got and last question let's talk about what you're doing right now so you left Google 6 months ago I left in January it's almost 11 months now 10 months now January 6th I left Google oh God so the clock is scking you told me in a year you can join Google back in a year yeah without an interview yeah clock is scking um what I'm up to is uh I I left Google to start a different company with Krishna I built uh I I started with d which was supposed to be LinkedIn for people in Tech I realized AI is coming people are copy pasting from chat GPT this is not going to work so then we pivoted into profile building and then we pivoted into interviews I don't relate much with interviews so that's why I Ste down I'm still playing a technical adviser role for them MH and then I had a side project dice DB it started as a redis replacement uh two and a half years back and now I've reignited that project again reuven he I got a unique Insight after studying papers 6 months straight every single weekend going through so many databases Source Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress a bit of it and then got that one unique Insight he this is one unique Insight that no other database in the world has literally no other database and this is one audacious problem that I want to solve right so right now now as of today I don't know what lies in the future but as of today I on a mission to solve one of the hardest problem in computer science sounds fancy I'm I'm a sales person now so there are two hard things in computer science naming things and cash inv validation we want to make second one OB okay so that's the Mission Vision we are chasing MH and uh we will be a super cach um our hypothesis is today every single microservice has its own transactional DV and has its own cach correct we don't want like each micros service having a trans DP makes sense because that's a source of Truth correct but what we hypothesize is that cash should be common across all services the reason is that if I want to if one service wants to access cash data of another service they should be able to directly access it rather than them stitching another data pipeline to replicate the more most recent changes here corre it should happen directly right so that's a fundamental shift in architecture we bringing from a m topology to a star topology where everybody talks to this and this will be horizontally scalable sharded bed all the buzz words that you can think of right it's right here all right and yeah that's what I'm on it's a fun problem to very cool um one last question I will ask so this specific project now you you're building almost database or a cache as you mentioned uh how did you gain enough knowledge and insights to be able to do that and now your answer is going to be read through code bases but how does something else okay tell me the answer is not through Cod the answer is learning on the go okay so again most people operate like that perfectionist in reality they are not right right right they want I'll read Sudan I'll read this five books and this 15 books and this blog and this thing and then I'll start building it you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes and then figuring out things on the go and it's a very cliche thing but and now I'm an entrepreneur and I feel it it's literally like jumping off the airplane and then you're stitching your parachute on while you are jumping right right while you are falling down and you are being scared every two months we change our vision of figure out something so you have to have that Knack of solving problem and like for example I never implemented right ahead l in my life but I had to do it so I went through open figure out what it does how it does wrote the code understood performance Chang it and then implemented so you being able to figure out the figure out t [Music] and this is true for almost all fields and all all domains and common all entrepreneurs but especially for engineering folks this is must this is not just for entrepreneurship but even for you know when you are working having an ability to Knack interesting challenges or interesting Solutions or hacks and all are in a more situation my been learning what the wor will be it will be not perform right for then it's it later just make sure that the code is extensible your code is plugable let say the volum interpretation I was talking about I wrote an abstract wall that does ball across sqlite also and across up and file also supp up and only file is not perform and I figure out another I just have to implement those three methods correct and then so being aware that what you are writing might not be most performant and being and making your code flexible enough to accommodate fut maybe let's say let's say 20x okay and I might not be able to take it to 50x ever right but if this product does well and I hire a person whose job is to optimize it can take it to 100 correct right need production everything Cod is not right that's the best part of our right you can always Circle back and change the things and all so that's the attitude and that's the difference is what I felt a lot of people are they they are self constrained it's not you start writing code you realize how easy it is correct exactly if you don't write code you always think it's very difficult yep I I agree 100% I think the practically start well guys lastly is great at giving challenges you have a challenge for the audience some random question that you know there's a quirky answer to I have a very interesting question let's see again folks who are watching this it's a very it's a very qu question the question is um you have to write off you have to you don't have to write a function you have to write the signature of a sorting function okay the function Declaration of a sorting function function you can pass array also link list also okay but you don't know if it's are or link list okay okay so in the function body you cannot have an if if AR do this if link list do this you cannot do that okay you have to write the signature of the function such that you pass it an AR it will sort it you pass it in link you pass in a link list it will s I just want signature of the function I don't even want the function the function implementation some level of overriding uh things like equal to imagine no it's C language nor okay list is a specific data structure we have created and in any way you would pass both of them as pointers actually you acting a void start correct correct it could be an err pointer it could be this what would be your function signature and if possible as an extension what would your implementation then without and your Cod should not have if this do this if this do this right so day day I have I have an idea but stop you have anything else for the audience anything you want to share last parting thoughts parting thoughts be curious yeah have right attitude most people uh stop being curious nobody should stop being curious I very childlike uh a lot of people don't take me seriously because of that and it's totally fine so long as I'm not losing the smile on my face I'm happy I'm making money and that's what matters but one thing that has helped me reach where I have reached is because of my curiosity and high bias for Action right because curios but if you're not acting on so a lot of people have started losing their cuity and I'm seeing that happening so just want to reinstate that fact cu the do is beautiful fall in love with her do and just dig deeper it's the best thing amazing with that I hope to see some of you at the top of the pyramid I'll see you guys in the next one bye-bye thanks thank that's why you need compar that's syst so if it's you don't need a compar you know that but you need to know how to access data now follow question the function that you're passing in is how you e the right and you know Cas of list the element I need need to be element right below it before it the thing is you don't care about complex here the key thing was abstraction like how we thinking of abstraction like finding the things which are different and then abstracting them out to either passing off a function or passing an argument or something Have function so it's add could be anything basically so three functions abstractor slapping index and 15 20 minutes able to and he knew that I was going to figure it out so they as me I this question Stay With Me Something I was always like you never anticipate questions [Applause] [Music]

then you switch to there go for 5 years for 5 years I was pretty early to join there uh 2018 f is when I joined and left in 2022 importantly how a company transitions well by the time we could react you already a billion dollar you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes right now as of today you I I don't know what playes in the future but as of today I have on a mission to solve one of the hardest problems in computer science so you cannot laugh you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you able to make talking about appraisals and promotions I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact thr it grow but like Tech is very rewarding the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro it is just the time spent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected 6.5 and that thing hurts me because all right hi everyone and welcome to a new podcast today we have arpit arpit how's it going all going good yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me thank you for traveling so far uh arpit was here to meet the super 30 folks for the people who don't know arpit has had an interesting journey we'll talk about it uh but recently he was telling me currently he's trying out a startup if it doesn't work out his plan is to go back to Google as a principal if it doesn't work out his plan sees to go to any company in India because all of his students are staff engineers at various companies in India that's the kind of person you're talking to there's this pyramid analogy that he gave a while back uh this isn't the pyramid this is the pyramid it's extremely flat by which I mean there a lot of people at the bottom but staff level principal level L it's really hard to find the right people he was telling me there's this opening in Google open for eight months so I'm going to call this the pyramid talk understanding how can you grow up the pyramid sd1 level or you know pressure level how do you stay the middle of the pyramid to make sure you don't get filtered out as you grow up with that arpit yeah thanks for thank for summarizing it but one change it's not fallback is not principal engineer engineer but the fallback is Staff engineer at Google but everything else is true 100% it's definitely much more tapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's not extremely tapered it's very flat at top right so yeah very few good people at the top perfect soit would love to know your journey from the starting when did you join College I joined in 2008 and uh graduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013 to5 okay and what were your colleges my uh graduation College was College of Engineering Pune and my masters was from triple Hyderabad all right very cool oh Tri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a good college very good one of the best outs you in the country yeah so did you feel that difference between bachelors and Masters so fortunately my graduation College was also good uh it is maharashtra's best college uh the kind of exposure I got during my college time was invaluable both during my graduation and during my masters the one change or another two key things that changed during my masters was number one uh the importance of coding culture which I did not have in my graduation college and the and the second thing was the importance of research culture which again was lacking in my btech college so that exposure was really nice uh unfortunately a lot of people who do Masters in India do it for placement purposes so the crowd had some like the core motivation of crowd was different the core motivation of crowding my B College was different but people who wanted to leverage the way they would want they have leveraged the Master's beautiful and the graduation beautifully but the difference is is there my B and master col all right would you say that was worth it going for a masters spending three years uh if you do your Masters within 3 years yes after 3 years no okay because it's not worth it given if like if your soul a is to get a job or let's say go to us or something it's better to crack and then do an internal switch without you losing your salary or having the 2-year career break you can uh reach to the position where you want to but if you think that or or other your motivation is to go deeper into your subjects deeper into your domain and whatnot Master is really good uh but you have to be very clear with your goal because you know there will be people having placement I have job job job internship internship internship placement placement placement but then if you look at them and then you decide that such you could have done job and then made an internal switch to a different country or different company and whatnot right so in my case my intention was to first of all get a good brand on my resum I be brutally honest second was to uh because what happened is after my graduation um I was working for a company called Sapa softwares my wife my then girlfriend now wife worked at basically Delhi MC M Bangalore and I applied and uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected and the offered 6.5 oh and that thing hurts me because it was not the disparity it was basically the parity that happened because of my college of graduation I was under assumption mra's best college but no one in Bangalore knew that and that hit me hard I also bang at that time and they not my resume and I realized and that was the thinging hey I need a good brand on my resume and I still need to pursue my passion for engineering which is where uped for gate and joined trip Hyderabad because they have their own entrance exam I did like 500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 something I was getting it g at that time I go at that time but then I chose to appear for triple it exam cracked it and then joined that college and then made the most I could two years right on very cool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch 2012 Masters 2015 all right I would assume after 2015 your fresher Journey started again I was a associate software engineer at D that's how it started yeah all right oh so your first offer was deaw yeah and I it in a month and a half in in a month and a half yeah interesting yeah I'm too quick to judge what was what was what did you not like about Finance no it was not about domain it was about the work that I was doing okay like even if I imagine you doing your Masters and then writing web Scrappers not so I was part of front office part of oil Natural Gas and energy sector so my job my job and my tech lead's job also was to scrape energy websites get the latest prices and then inest it in the database for Brokers to use right like no not going to happen not going to do this for like 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life I immediately made a switch to pra and pror was aggressively hiring I a lot of people from trip went toor right right right and then I joined devop and then life took care of itself you said in practce you started to devops yeah oh super interesting so okay I would love to know more about this so you uh I would assume in college how much devops did you do zero zero I did not even know how server what is a server how it starts what is a web server how it connect I have no idea I just learned it on the go I go it so prao was a startup back then I was very fast Peak at the 2015 2016 got it so how did you learn on the job how did you make your learning curve so high while you were there so to be honest in for me what the fuel was simple that although I graduated in 2012 I was still a fresher in 2015 so effectively I did my btech for seven years right right so I had to make up right for because I was not making any money at that time one year I job one year of job I did I put it in my mtech fees so I had to cover up because my batches were already senior software engineers and some of them were teches so I had to over compensate and because I had to over compensate I'll go all in worked really hard made an impact got my first promotion in 6 months so I was one of the two or three freshers who got promoted out of batch of 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired and two or three got promoted I was one of them me a Bazar Raja I remember three of us definitely who got promoted at that time and and confidence although the doain was entirely new but I still did it and one of the key highlights that was there was how although I was part of devops I was also part of an internal JavaScript regulation team I had no idea of JavaScript but my first principle thinking my thought process my attitude uh I built internal portals and whatnot at that time react was just picking up and I started learning it it's fun although it's not supposed to be done by a devop but I was still doing it and seeing that I was part of a internal team for JS Guild where we like one F from each team like we were like seven eight people team who were regulating JavaScript usage in the organization that hey which packages should you use will do the vulnerability checking this that everybody will download package from the same Source not from the standard npm right and whatnot got it so the great thing was I never said throughout my experience and then I started climbing up ladder much faster because of that very cool uh do you remember any experiences of I don't know good things that you saw at prao good challenges that you got introduced to U considering the scale of the company back then yeah so at prao um I was handling entire infrastructure so I was handling uh Dev infrastructure and in the later half of my uh sprinted PR I was Al handling a bit of production so one of the key things that I learned there was how to manage elastic search cluster so pract did not use a managed offering used to run elastic search cluster on ec2 instances at that time so what I had to do was I learned it first and then applied it that how do you Ure how do you handle Hot Shot problem what if one of The Shard is becoming piping H because of all the load that is coming in how do you solve it how do you balance and all those Concepts that I learned while managing my own cluster that helps it still helps me when I am doing database migration and I'm doing anything else because the underlying Concepts exactly the same that is one very cool uh and you worked at pror for two years one and a half year one and a half year what was your next switch that was Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay so Finance to Startup toig and then I moved to so Amazon Hyderabad was there I was part of team called Fast data Technologies so fast data so we used to take care of cold tearing of hot data so let's say their main database is transactional database let's say hypothetical example it's MyQ it was not my SQL but let's take example of my SQL is a hot storage now what we used to do was we used to take data out and move it to a cold tier which is S3 okay more important it's not Arch most people think I moving data to S3 it's archive it's not archive i have to seamlessly be able to query across the data right be it hot TI be it cold tier okay we do this to say cost mhm so we were one of the largest customers of S3 like my small team was one of the largest customers of S3 like we were competing directly with Netflix with respect to the amount of data we save oh wow so that's the scale of Amazon and I just learned it while it was there what it takes to do this and whatnot so we used to run job jobs that used to download that used to extract the data transform it a bit create M database store it on S3 and more importantly not losing an ability to query the data you could see this in example as if you use Amazon app uh you go to orders page and you see your past orders the most recent six month orders come from hot storage when you do it change it and like that was literally our customer okay so when you change it uh before 6 months that all comes from S3 all right so that is the hot storage and Cold Storage uh that we did at that time very cool how how are you querying from S3 directly how would you run so that's the thing so that is where you have to store your data in a way that you have indexes on your ec2 instances because you still have to query it you will not be storing the data on E2 ins you'll be storing indexes on E2 ins kind of and then uh when you make a request it comes to a central router that router checks the hot storage if it has the data it Serv it if not it comes to Cold Storage Cold Storage is one of the servers that server has the data great it serves it if not goes through SD gets the data caches it for some time and then serves it so but that when you're doing this on S3 it's not you can think of it as nine implementation is one file for each order M but then you would have so many files correct which is just impractical so which is where you have to create a bunch of embedded databases where you store this key value store in a efficient format and that small index is loaded here so that you still know where to go and read the data and then serve it so without losing an ability to query the data on S3 so we have we did pointed reads of a fraction of data within a file on S3 all right so you save a ton of money that scale of Amazon Super same all right oh that's Prett cool so saying most data that's archival in Amazon things like past orders some of it comes from hot storage a lot of it is S3 I would assume most of it a lot majority of them is because you're very likely to query your most recent order yeah and not so likely to query your older order so all of that comes from us very cool uh so this was your work at Amazon any other interesting project you worked on Amazon was this all right then you switch to there go for five years for five years five years yeah okay I was pretty to join there uh 2018 FB is when I joined and left in 2022 2018 FB so what were your what number employee were you on in the tech team my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow it went like a it like a dummy ID when I used to say this everybody used Tock right so my employ C was 123 I was mostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Tech oh wow very early so I started I started handling search okay there buil entire search ground up uh then looked at then while I was mentoring back end folks here and there doing Cod reviews I was a senior most person in the at that time oh so a lot of stuff uh had to be handled and all quite fun time um then I joined as a technical architect there uh slightly loaded title Butch architect I got and I was mentoring backend people I was handling search search a bit of gamification and uh mentorship optimization datab optimization and all but a lot of my energy was on search then I built notification center Ina notification center uh Pura and then I transition into leadership role okay into eing management then I built search sorry then I built s team ground up again my dev's experience at pror helped me and I buil entire team count up and then I took also took care of data engineering team five years passed gradu move to Google nice good times unacademy was my best experience so far okay undoubtedly when it comes to people learning job what what was the best part about unacademy working there to be honest it sound cringy but yeah everything because uh it never felt like it was someone else's company I never felt like an employee never always took but deep inside I knew how much I cared for the product how much I car for the company to win so I still remember every Friday s used to go down me and my friend becauseas we used to work and come and make it uh make it up and rning again while Tech we used to have game nights every Friday and every Friday while that game night was happening the search used to go down because of the peak traffic that we used to get right and then we sat once and for all so yeah people were amazing uh Tech was very nice I learned a lot of hacks there that um and since then I've been saying this um what matters is business product and then engineering engineering is always an unbl right nobody cares about a solid principle liquid principle gas principle if your business is not surviving cor or if your business is not driving you don't have a good product so I understood the importance of that and more importantly how company transitions no from a very small company a little startup and then when venture capital is infused and a huge venture capital is infused what it takes for you to operate at massive scale well by the time we could react we were already a billion dollar and then so many [Music] people so much of stuff that were happening that it was becoming difficult more difficult by the day to manage it but then that was my learning thing let's build deep ground up now already has an experience come an em and build a team right and so on so for so it was very nice combination uh but again the curse of becoming bigger prior like things we used to say now becomes official Gade and that is something that we did not like it much like all the old folks we like better off we would do it right so a lot of those things scpt up but that was a good learning that you understand how a company Transitions and you have to adapt to it you cannot just say it anything will still be chaotic right at that skill you have to have those processes if you don't have processes you know what all things can go wrong so that was very good uh learning not just from coding coding side but also from what it takes to build a team scal team importance of processes um setting up right processes security practices zero trust on employees so that was very nice very cool uh yeah I lot to talk about your journey there considering I'm assuming when you joined the devop pipeline was very janky and by the time you left I would assume since it was a company you know everything was stable as you said employee management things like these Journey first I'm assuming you L it an academ is also one product this is when you open any Tex page yeah when it comes to the front end when it comes to their you know if you've seen their live video you've probably seen it never seen a better one everyone else uses Zoom unacademy has its own live true so would love to know I don't know about the product was great one of the best products the secret source of an academy was the passion of people the people who are building it never again I I again repeat he we all never felt it was someone else's company we all were very proud of what we were building so first years was like the best for us we never thought we built video calling for educator payments part unacademy subscription was when we were there like entire business model changing we saw impact of business model nobody had done subscriptions in N Tech anad was the first one to subscriptions in Tech right so that was fa and because we were so engrossed with the vision and we felt our vision plus we had some very amazing designers and all they the found then gave then the business sorry then the product design guidelines were so in place that everybody stuck to what was part of the uh guidelines and all and it was very well taught so him kov both are extremely focused on on Crafting great user experience and that is shown through and through produ development life cycle engineering was our passion busing then we also we Cann make cor it very cool uh do you can you talk about the infrastructure at unacademy finally by the time you left or is that IND infrastructure is it what inra size of infra where did you guys deployed what cloud what technology it was all AWS all AWS we already have blocks I'm not spilling the VIN here it's all out there we were on AWS uh completely on AWS we had uh almost no plans of moving out because of the tight coupling of our services deployment Frameworks and what not with AWS and and that was primarily our infra um multi- region yes uh Singapore was our primary monolithic region and live classes were driven from Mumbai okay because when an academy started Mumbai data center wasn't there right so that's why all the services all the backend Services were in uh Singapore got it while live classes because of minimizing latency were all in Mumbai these were like key different key difference uh sizing and all was above average than most companies in India U we are playing a pretty hefty amount to AWS as our monthly bill which was pretty interesting I never thought but that was that was a big learning and more importantly that when you have this big of an infra it's one of my biggest St was it's not the matter of what goes wrong it's matter of where it goes [Music] wrong yeah if you assume let's say one in one year goes down one time on average so when you have a massive infra it's not the matter of what it's matter of when when it will go down and you have to be prepared for things going wrong things shutting down abruptly um one of the most interesting challenges we used to get and we used to shout at AWS for this is their EVS volume so there so we use RDS to host the database and then EBS volume used to keep flipping right and it used to keep crashing and then it it used to lead to our realiz that because of the size of infrastructure it's bound to happen and you have to be ready with that right like what do you do to make sure that you are not impacted much right so interest all right so not F face challenges AWS is not able to handle our load yet or our bandwidth yet it was actually not AWS is not able to handle it's like it could be because AWS is pretty vast and our traffic is not as much as like I was giving an example of what we did at what I did at Amazon the thing is that you cannot consider your infrastructure to be always up and running correct when your infra size is large things going down is much more C you cannot think of it as an exceptional event it's not exception it's a normal you have to be okay with that so that was our biggest learning thing being prepared for things going wrong having a fall back having a right that we had to ensure across all of our services also that was pretty interesting and challenging very cool cool U 5 years at an academy then Google back to Big Tech back to Big yeah big Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah I joined Google I was uh India for data Pro Data proess managed EOS system man SP what actually unfortunately fortunately people have AWS in so gcp equalent of that is data right so I was part of performance uh gcp data performance so we used to take care of uh making sure that Apaches Park that we run runs the best on gcp so we used to manipulate Apaches those Vari of apach spark add our patches to it and make it hyper optimized to run on gcp workloads all right so this way our customers get best service we don't use things out of the box from open source right we optimize it for uh our Hardware our infrastructure and then pass on the benefits to the customers so I was IND for data all right had you worked on similar problems before never so I I have to learn on the even at I was doing search I never worked on search at practor I worked on devops I never work I never started a server right then at Amazon I was doing colding of big data I never worked on that uh an academy search never worked on notification never worked on feed but again for me it was plus I never managed a team I never built a team from ground up uh never did inra rotation so there are a lot of things that were new almost always but having that right to learn what's so tough in it nothing tough like you just have to put in the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro in it it's just the time spent in that doain that's the only difference I agree if I spend enough time same time as that person I would be able to know the same things the same set of things maybe even better right maybe even more than what that person knows so with that it was easier for me to like that was the mindset that I I've always operated on right makes sense that that leads to two questions U one is how was your interview process at these companies considering yeah that's the first question so one thing I realize is it's all about how you communicate during intervie how how strong is your conviction H now most people they fear or they're intimidated by oh my God this is something new I will not be able to do it but if you showcase a high conviction in my case because of my personality because of my slightly Ecentric personality I'm able to radiate confidence better I'm able to speak better so it's about if I have high conviction that I'll figure it out M then the hiring manager also has a high conviction all okay and the inter process is almost always like they judge you on your problem solving skills and this and that if you're able to articulate your thoughts well you're able to solve the problems that have been asked in the interview you'll 100% be able to uh crack the inter definitely Stu is going there and making an impact that takes time so you cannot Bluff you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you are able to make an impact after you join right so you cannot lie over here so your conviction needs to be high but backed by your past achievements right it cannot be like any not to up then you lose your job right so this is something that I always tell people that you should radiate confidence you should have High conviction in your abilities but it should be backed by your past data right been there done that for and whatnot with Awards recognitions impact output outcome some and uh interview process mostly this and they see how Keen you are into solving this problem most people are not keen tackling the new new challenge most I I worked on search I'll solve search I worked on this I done this now imagine how many people in India or even in the world would be there who are working on open source Apaches part and optimizing its performance you cannot expect this kind of work to be like you cannot expect to find people who have done similar work right right right right possible prodop you can still find people with similar experience for this obscure type thing it's incredibly difficult which is where your first principle thinking right your at to solve problems and all of that K in so interview difference is more about you showing your faith and them reciprocating in the right s and again it's their responsibility to evaluate better right if they have made a bad call hiring me for example they would change their interess right either I either I or they learn yeah the second question here is will very relevant for people people get very over with the new technology so you know I think if I ask most people here they'll be like they're going to judge me on impact so how do you think you did that how do you think that is the thought process of people I think people don't generally like computer science most of them said everybody has an inclination right but why do you think people have that attitude I think it's more like they confident in cracking interviews because it's cracking an interview is sort of rigged right at some point it's it's like preparing examination yeah you always Tau to prepare well for examination and that's end of story exactly you never told that's a situation so most people one I realiz is we are all taught to study a fixed syllabus M crack an exam join a college or join a job what people feel in college exact same thing they feel at job okay how do I differentiate yeah how do I crack marks how do I do this college m still is there also you have like different examinations to crack marks soob people try to manipulate or they try to have this as de [Music] they draw right right right so everything so which is why bu for the problem it's in two parts first is startups and second is Big Tech right now big Tech process is very uh strategized it's very form you exactly know okay these five things I'm supposed to do and this is the rating I would get right so that's why good students always do well at Big because they exactly know what they Ching you have to have you have to be owner of at least one service you have to drive business impact of at least one if it's not written then manager would tell them because manager people are because manager is also chasing some goals correct correct so good students do very well at Big Texs you there is a structure right there is a checklist that you are following exactly very similar to your checklist during your college days and during your exam preparation phas but things become very interesting when it's a startup when it's ambiguous when manager know and priorties keep shifting and this and that this is where people will find the hardest and to be honest more people work in these type of companies than big Tech correct correct so which is why most people find it hard so one thing I always tell key it does not matter the the lines of quote that you have shipped what is stable is it driving the impact it is supposed to because I've known I've known a person who has built three killer features but none of them worked guess if that person would have gotten a promotion or not I would assume no no again was that person's fault no but it was a collective failure of for examp you're there you win your team wins you cannot say because your the outcome see output is in your control outcome is not in your exactly outcome is a collective effort it's Collective effort of entire Team Management leadership business marketing everything right so whatever is in your control you do your best and then because in my case also there have been two products that have been completely scraped after I work on it for 8 months did I whine about it I feel bad but then I had to make sure that I am having enough other impactful stuff right and people need to understand and people find it difficult because they are amb envirment they don't find it right so having an ability to spot he this is impactful or this is the bare minimum efforts I would drive the max impact and I could go above and beyond here is important I'll give a simple example like Extreme Concrete example is um let's say I know my project is going nowhere now what should what should I do I know that this project is doomed to fail and I know I would not be getting a promotion what should you do one okay here are ideas you talk to your manager manager probably manag you are being so p you are seeing it your manager is not seeing it exactly so that that part is closed second is I would just make sure have some other impact that I can show but then manag would say your your entire should be here yeah third option is you try to improve your visibility in the same time right company TI talk though ah okay help other people Mentor few folks make help others will you are collecting your browny points this is at one point this is literally what I did really okay I would assum at Pig Tech not start up start so because if you see that something might not work you have to start working on your plan B much sooner right right without telling other people that this is my plan right and without you showcasing your disinterest or your pism because if you show your pessimism people working with you will become negative yeah you should be very this that and what without putting yourself in bad books you have to still drive in back because obious Seasons because this project is important for organization so you start working on Parallel things right at least because then you that you could not have done if you were busy if this was impactful very high focus you could not have done that right so use that time to drive other things and that's how you still make sure that throughout your Span in your organization wherever you are working you have something impactful every month coming out right it may be your direct work it may be your indirect work through mentorship and all it could be your visibility thing it could be your influence it could be your new process that you have introduced so you have to make sure that you are making you're delivering enough impact right in one year talking about appraisals and promotions so I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact show it grow um but like Tech is very rewarding um even if you're working you know in India only us it's very reporting even in India so what do you think if someone is you know growing up the pyramid correctly paying their debts doing everything right and growing up to the pyramid how much money can they retire with in India uh you know humbly if they're working not taking any random bets they weren't early at zato and that IPO they w at a Google and Amazon um you know paid their debts so typically salaries based salaries would cap software around 1C even for a descent if you take that as ceiling 1C is a ceiling that someone would hit uh to one CR for 5 years would be almost negligible expenses and all so roughly five to six like would end up making a million dollars right 7 to8 CR on a above average basis right right so if you're investing right and if you're you know just doing a job and I would assume there are stocks on top yeah so if you add that up um by the time you retire you're probably pretty comfortable yeah most people would be extremely comfortable you just need one big Tech experience or a well-known startup experience in your resume within first 7 to 8 years okay then it's a smooth sailing after that go then even if you do average or above average at least you'll get interview you keep making you'll keep consistently making that bare minimum amount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till 4045 in Tech got and last question let's talk about what you're doing right now so you left Google 6 months ago I left in January it's almost 11 months now 10 months now January 6th I left Google oh God so the clock is scking you told me in a year you can join Google back in a year yeah without an interview yeah clock is scking um what I'm up to is uh I I left Google to start a different company with Krishna I built uh I I started with d which was supposed to be LinkedIn for people in Tech I realized AI is coming people are copy pasting from chat GPT this is not going to work so then we pivoted into profile building and then we pivoted into interviews I don't relate much with interviews so that's why I Ste down I'm still playing a technical adviser role for them MH and then I had a side project dice DB it started as a redis replacement uh two and a half years back and now I've reignited that project again reuven he I got a unique Insight after studying papers 6 months straight every single weekend going through so many databases Source Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress a bit of it and then got that one unique Insight he this is one unique Insight that no other database in the world has literally no other database and this is one audacious problem that I want to solve right so right now now as of today I don't know what lies in the future but as of today I on a mission to solve one of the hardest problem in computer science sounds fancy I'm I'm a sales person now so there are two hard things in computer science naming things and cash inv validation we want to make second one OB okay so that's the Mission Vision we are chasing MH and uh we will be a super cach um our hypothesis is today every single microservice has its own transactional DV and has its own cach correct we don't want like each micros service having a trans DP makes sense because that's a source of Truth correct but what we hypothesize is that cash should be common across all services the reason is that if I want to if one service wants to access cash data of another service they should be able to directly access it rather than them stitching another data pipeline to replicate the more most recent changes here corre it should happen directly right so that's a fundamental shift in architecture we bringing from a m topology to a star topology where everybody talks to this and this will be horizontally scalable sharded bed all the buzz words that you can think of right it's right here all right and yeah that's what I'm on it's a fun problem to very cool um one last question I will ask so this specific project now you you're building almost database or a cache as you mentioned uh how did you gain enough knowledge and insights to be able to do that and now your answer is going to be read through code bases but how does something else okay tell me the answer is not through Cod the answer is learning on the go okay so again most people operate like that perfectionist in reality they are not right right right they want I'll read Sudan I'll read this five books and this 15 books and this blog and this thing and then I'll start building it you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes and then figuring out things on the go and it's a very cliche thing but and now I'm an entrepreneur and I feel it it's literally like jumping off the airplane and then you're stitching your parachute on while you are jumping right right while you are falling down and you are being scared every two months we change our vision of figure out something so you have to have that Knack of solving problem and like for example I never implemented right ahead l in my life but I had to do it so I went through open figure out what it does how it does wrote the code understood performance Chang it and then implemented so you being able to figure out the figure out t [Music] and this is true for almost all fields and all all domains and common all entrepreneurs but especially for engineering folks this is must this is not just for entrepreneurship but even for you know when you are working having an ability to Knack interesting challenges or interesting Solutions or hacks and all are in a more situation my been learning what the wor will be it will be not perform right for then it's it later just make sure that the code is extensible your code is plugable let say the volum interpretation I was talking about I wrote an abstract wall that does ball across sqlite also and across up and file also supp up and only file is not perform and I figure out another I just have to implement those three methods correct and then so being aware that what you are writing might not be most performant and being and making your code flexible enough to accommodate fut maybe let's say let's say 20x okay and I might not be able to take it to 50x ever right but if this product does well and I hire a person whose job is to optimize it can take it to 100 correct right need production everything Cod is not right that's the best part of our right you can always Circle back and change the things and all so that's the attitude and that's the difference is what I felt a lot of people are they they are self constrained it's not you start writing code you realize how easy it is correct exactly if you don't write code you always think it's very difficult yep I I agree 100% I think the practically start well guys lastly is great at giving challenges you have a challenge for the audience some random question that you know there's a quirky answer to I have a very interesting question let's see again folks who are watching this it's a very it's a very qu question the question is um you have to write off you have to you don't have to write a function you have to write the signature of a sorting function okay the function Declaration of a sorting function function you can pass array also link list also okay but you don't know if it's are or link list okay okay so in the function body you cannot have an if if AR do this if link list do this you cannot do that okay you have to write the signature of the function such that you pass it an AR it will sort it you pass it in link you pass in a link list it will s I just want signature of the function I don't even want the function the function implementation some level of overriding uh things like equal to imagine no it's C language nor okay list is a specific data structure we have created and in any way you would pass both of them as pointers actually you acting a void start correct correct it could be an err pointer it could be this what would be your function signature and if possible as an extension what would your implementation then without and your Cod should not have if this do this if this do this right so day day I have I have an idea but stop you have anything else for the audience anything you want to share last parting thoughts parting thoughts be curious yeah have right attitude most people uh stop being curious nobody should stop being curious I very childlike uh a lot of people don't take me seriously because of that and it's totally fine so long as I'm not losing the smile on my face I'm happy I'm making money and that's what matters but one thing that has helped me reach where I have reached is because of my curiosity and high bias for Action right because curios but if you're not acting on so a lot of people have started losing their cuity and I'm seeing that happening so just want to reinstate that fact cu the do is beautiful fall in love with her do and just dig deeper it's the best thing amazing with that I hope to see some of you at the top of the pyramid I'll see you guys in the next one bye-bye thanks thank that's why you need compar that's syst so if it's you don't need a compar you know that but you need to know how to access data now follow question the function that you're passing in is how you e the right and you know Cas of list the element I need need to be element right below it before it the thing is you don't care about complex here the key thing was abstraction like how we thinking of abstraction like finding the things which are different and then abstracting them out to either passing off a function or passing an argument or something Have function so it's add could be anything basically so three functions abstractor slapping index and 15 20 minutes able to and he knew that I was going to figure it out so they as me I this question Stay With Me Something I was always like you never anticipate questions [Applause] [Music]

then you switch to there go for 5 years for 5 years I was pretty early to join there uh 2018 f is when I joined and left in 2022 importantly how a company transitions well by the time we could react you already a billion dollar you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes right now as of today you I I don't know what playes in the future but as of today I have on a mission to solve one of the hardest problems in computer science so you cannot laugh you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you able to make talking about appraisals and promotions I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact thr it grow but like Tech is very rewarding the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro it is just the time spent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected 6.5 and that thing hurts me because all right hi everyone and welcome to a new podcast today we have arpit arpit how's it going all going good yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me thank you for traveling so far uh arpit was here to meet the super 30 folks for the people who don't know arpit has had an interesting journey we'll talk about it uh but recently he was telling me currently he's trying out a startup if it doesn't work out his plan is to go back to Google as a principal if it doesn't work out his plan sees to go to any company in India because all of his students are staff engineers at various companies in India that's the kind of person you're talking to there's this pyramid analogy that he gave a while back uh this isn't the pyramid this is the pyramid it's extremely flat by which I mean there a lot of people at the bottom but staff level principal level L it's really hard to find the right people he was telling me there's this opening in Google open for eight months so I'm going to call this the pyramid talk understanding how can you grow up the pyramid sd1 level or you know pressure level how do you stay the middle of the pyramid to make sure you don't get filtered out as you grow up with that arpit yeah thanks for thank for summarizing it but one change it's not fallback is not principal engineer engineer but the fallback is Staff engineer at Google but everything else is true 100% it's definitely much more tapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's not extremely tapered it's very flat at top right so yeah very few good people at the top perfect soit would love to know your journey from the starting when did you join College I joined in 2008 and uh graduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013 to5 okay and what were your colleges my uh graduation College was College of Engineering Pune and my masters was from triple Hyderabad all right very cool oh Tri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a good college very good one of the best outs you in the country yeah so did you feel that difference between bachelors and Masters so fortunately my graduation College was also good uh it is maharashtra's best college uh the kind of exposure I got during my college time was invaluable both during my graduation and during my masters the one change or another two key things that changed during my masters was number one uh the importance of coding culture which I did not have in my graduation college and the and the second thing was the importance of research culture which again was lacking in my btech college so that exposure was really nice uh unfortunately a lot of people who do Masters in India do it for placement purposes so the crowd had some like the core motivation of crowd was different the core motivation of crowding my B College was different but people who wanted to leverage the way they would want they have leveraged the Master's beautiful and the graduation beautifully but the difference is is there my B and master col all right would you say that was worth it going for a masters spending three years uh if you do your Masters within 3 years yes after 3 years no okay because it's not worth it given if like if your soul a is to get a job or let's say go to us or something it's better to crack and then do an internal switch without you losing your salary or having the 2-year career break you can uh reach to the position where you want to but if you think that or or other your motivation is to go deeper into your subjects deeper into your domain and whatnot Master is really good uh but you have to be very clear with your goal because you know there will be people having placement I have job job job internship internship internship placement placement placement but then if you look at them and then you decide that such you could have done job and then made an internal switch to a different country or different company and whatnot right so in my case my intention was to first of all get a good brand on my resum I be brutally honest second was to uh because what happened is after my graduation um I was working for a company called Sapa softwares my wife my then girlfriend now wife worked at basically Delhi MC M Bangalore and I applied and uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected and the offered 6.5 oh and that thing hurts me because it was not the disparity it was basically the parity that happened because of my college of graduation I was under assumption mra's best college but no one in Bangalore knew that and that hit me hard I also bang at that time and they not my resume and I realized and that was the thinging hey I need a good brand on my resume and I still need to pursue my passion for engineering which is where uped for gate and joined trip Hyderabad because they have their own entrance exam I did like 500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 something I was getting it g at that time I go at that time but then I chose to appear for triple it exam cracked it and then joined that college and then made the most I could two years right on very cool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch 2012 Masters 2015 all right I would assume after 2015 your fresher Journey started again I was a associate software engineer at D that's how it started yeah all right oh so your first offer was deaw yeah and I it in a month and a half in in a month and a half yeah interesting yeah I'm too quick to judge what was what was what did you not like about Finance no it was not about domain it was about the work that I was doing okay like even if I imagine you doing your Masters and then writing web Scrappers not so I was part of front office part of oil Natural Gas and energy sector so my job my job and my tech lead's job also was to scrape energy websites get the latest prices and then inest it in the database for Brokers to use right like no not going to happen not going to do this for like 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life I immediately made a switch to pra and pror was aggressively hiring I a lot of people from trip went toor right right right and then I joined devop and then life took care of itself you said in practce you started to devops yeah oh super interesting so okay I would love to know more about this so you uh I would assume in college how much devops did you do zero zero I did not even know how server what is a server how it starts what is a web server how it connect I have no idea I just learned it on the go I go it so prao was a startup back then I was very fast Peak at the 2015 2016 got it so how did you learn on the job how did you make your learning curve so high while you were there so to be honest in for me what the fuel was simple that although I graduated in 2012 I was still a fresher in 2015 so effectively I did my btech for seven years right right so I had to make up right for because I was not making any money at that time one year I job one year of job I did I put it in my mtech fees so I had to cover up because my batches were already senior software engineers and some of them were teches so I had to over compensate and because I had to over compensate I'll go all in worked really hard made an impact got my first promotion in 6 months so I was one of the two or three freshers who got promoted out of batch of 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired and two or three got promoted I was one of them me a Bazar Raja I remember three of us definitely who got promoted at that time and and confidence although the doain was entirely new but I still did it and one of the key highlights that was there was how although I was part of devops I was also part of an internal JavaScript regulation team I had no idea of JavaScript but my first principle thinking my thought process my attitude uh I built internal portals and whatnot at that time react was just picking up and I started learning it it's fun although it's not supposed to be done by a devop but I was still doing it and seeing that I was part of a internal team for JS Guild where we like one F from each team like we were like seven eight people team who were regulating JavaScript usage in the organization that hey which packages should you use will do the vulnerability checking this that everybody will download package from the same Source not from the standard npm right and whatnot got it so the great thing was I never said throughout my experience and then I started climbing up ladder much faster because of that very cool uh do you remember any experiences of I don't know good things that you saw at prao good challenges that you got introduced to U considering the scale of the company back then yeah so at prao um I was handling entire infrastructure so I was handling uh Dev infrastructure and in the later half of my uh sprinted PR I was Al handling a bit of production so one of the key things that I learned there was how to manage elastic search cluster so pract did not use a managed offering used to run elastic search cluster on ec2 instances at that time so what I had to do was I learned it first and then applied it that how do you Ure how do you handle Hot Shot problem what if one of The Shard is becoming piping H because of all the load that is coming in how do you solve it how do you balance and all those Concepts that I learned while managing my own cluster that helps it still helps me when I am doing database migration and I'm doing anything else because the underlying Concepts exactly the same that is one very cool uh and you worked at pror for two years one and a half year one and a half year what was your next switch that was Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay so Finance to Startup toig and then I moved to so Amazon Hyderabad was there I was part of team called Fast data Technologies so fast data so we used to take care of cold tearing of hot data so let's say their main database is transactional database let's say hypothetical example it's MyQ it was not my SQL but let's take example of my SQL is a hot storage now what we used to do was we used to take data out and move it to a cold tier which is S3 okay more important it's not Arch most people think I moving data to S3 it's archive it's not archive i have to seamlessly be able to query across the data right be it hot TI be it cold tier okay we do this to say cost mhm so we were one of the largest customers of S3 like my small team was one of the largest customers of S3 like we were competing directly with Netflix with respect to the amount of data we save oh wow so that's the scale of Amazon and I just learned it while it was there what it takes to do this and whatnot so we used to run job jobs that used to download that used to extract the data transform it a bit create M database store it on S3 and more importantly not losing an ability to query the data you could see this in example as if you use Amazon app uh you go to orders page and you see your past orders the most recent six month orders come from hot storage when you do it change it and like that was literally our customer okay so when you change it uh before 6 months that all comes from S3 all right so that is the hot storage and Cold Storage uh that we did at that time very cool how how are you querying from S3 directly how would you run so that's the thing so that is where you have to store your data in a way that you have indexes on your ec2 instances because you still have to query it you will not be storing the data on E2 ins you'll be storing indexes on E2 ins kind of and then uh when you make a request it comes to a central router that router checks the hot storage if it has the data it Serv it if not it comes to Cold Storage Cold Storage is one of the servers that server has the data great it serves it if not goes through SD gets the data caches it for some time and then serves it so but that when you're doing this on S3 it's not you can think of it as nine implementation is one file for each order M but then you would have so many files correct which is just impractical so which is where you have to create a bunch of embedded databases where you store this key value store in a efficient format and that small index is loaded here so that you still know where to go and read the data and then serve it so without losing an ability to query the data on S3 so we have we did pointed reads of a fraction of data within a file on S3 all right so you save a ton of money that scale of Amazon Super same all right oh that's Prett cool so saying most data that's archival in Amazon things like past orders some of it comes from hot storage a lot of it is S3 I would assume most of it a lot majority of them is because you're very likely to query your most recent order yeah and not so likely to query your older order so all of that comes from us very cool uh so this was your work at Amazon any other interesting project you worked on Amazon was this all right then you switch to there go for five years for five years five years yeah okay I was pretty to join there uh 2018 FB is when I joined and left in 2022 2018 FB so what were your what number employee were you on in the tech team my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow it went like a it like a dummy ID when I used to say this everybody used Tock right so my employ C was 123 I was mostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Tech oh wow very early so I started I started handling search okay there buil entire search ground up uh then looked at then while I was mentoring back end folks here and there doing Cod reviews I was a senior most person in the at that time oh so a lot of stuff uh had to be handled and all quite fun time um then I joined as a technical architect there uh slightly loaded title Butch architect I got and I was mentoring backend people I was handling search search a bit of gamification and uh mentorship optimization datab optimization and all but a lot of my energy was on search then I built notification center Ina notification center uh Pura and then I transition into leadership role okay into eing management then I built search sorry then I built s team ground up again my dev's experience at pror helped me and I buil entire team count up and then I took also took care of data engineering team five years passed gradu move to Google nice good times unacademy was my best experience so far okay undoubtedly when it comes to people learning job what what was the best part about unacademy working there to be honest it sound cringy but yeah everything because uh it never felt like it was someone else's company I never felt like an employee never always took but deep inside I knew how much I cared for the product how much I car for the company to win so I still remember every Friday s used to go down me and my friend becauseas we used to work and come and make it uh make it up and rning again while Tech we used to have game nights every Friday and every Friday while that game night was happening the search used to go down because of the peak traffic that we used to get right and then we sat once and for all so yeah people were amazing uh Tech was very nice I learned a lot of hacks there that um and since then I've been saying this um what matters is business product and then engineering engineering is always an unbl right nobody cares about a solid principle liquid principle gas principle if your business is not surviving cor or if your business is not driving you don't have a good product so I understood the importance of that and more importantly how company transitions no from a very small company a little startup and then when venture capital is infused and a huge venture capital is infused what it takes for you to operate at massive scale well by the time we could react we were already a billion dollar and then so many [Music] people so much of stuff that were happening that it was becoming difficult more difficult by the day to manage it but then that was my learning thing let's build deep ground up now already has an experience come an em and build a team right and so on so for so it was very nice combination uh but again the curse of becoming bigger prior like things we used to say now becomes official Gade and that is something that we did not like it much like all the old folks we like better off we would do it right so a lot of those things scpt up but that was a good learning that you understand how a company Transitions and you have to adapt to it you cannot just say it anything will still be chaotic right at that skill you have to have those processes if you don't have processes you know what all things can go wrong so that was very good uh learning not just from coding coding side but also from what it takes to build a team scal team importance of processes um setting up right processes security practices zero trust on employees so that was very nice very cool uh yeah I lot to talk about your journey there considering I'm assuming when you joined the devop pipeline was very janky and by the time you left I would assume since it was a company you know everything was stable as you said employee management things like these Journey first I'm assuming you L it an academ is also one product this is when you open any Tex page yeah when it comes to the front end when it comes to their you know if you've seen their live video you've probably seen it never seen a better one everyone else uses Zoom unacademy has its own live true so would love to know I don't know about the product was great one of the best products the secret source of an academy was the passion of people the people who are building it never again I I again repeat he we all never felt it was someone else's company we all were very proud of what we were building so first years was like the best for us we never thought we built video calling for educator payments part unacademy subscription was when we were there like entire business model changing we saw impact of business model nobody had done subscriptions in N Tech anad was the first one to subscriptions in Tech right so that was fa and because we were so engrossed with the vision and we felt our vision plus we had some very amazing designers and all they the found then gave then the business sorry then the product design guidelines were so in place that everybody stuck to what was part of the uh guidelines and all and it was very well taught so him kov both are extremely focused on on Crafting great user experience and that is shown through and through produ development life cycle engineering was our passion busing then we also we Cann make cor it very cool uh do you can you talk about the infrastructure at unacademy finally by the time you left or is that IND infrastructure is it what inra size of infra where did you guys deployed what cloud what technology it was all AWS all AWS we already have blocks I'm not spilling the VIN here it's all out there we were on AWS uh completely on AWS we had uh almost no plans of moving out because of the tight coupling of our services deployment Frameworks and what not with AWS and and that was primarily our infra um multi- region yes uh Singapore was our primary monolithic region and live classes were driven from Mumbai okay because when an academy started Mumbai data center wasn't there right so that's why all the services all the backend Services were in uh Singapore got it while live classes because of minimizing latency were all in Mumbai these were like key different key difference uh sizing and all was above average than most companies in India U we are playing a pretty hefty amount to AWS as our monthly bill which was pretty interesting I never thought but that was that was a big learning and more importantly that when you have this big of an infra it's one of my biggest St was it's not the matter of what goes wrong it's matter of where it goes [Music] wrong yeah if you assume let's say one in one year goes down one time on average so when you have a massive infra it's not the matter of what it's matter of when when it will go down and you have to be prepared for things going wrong things shutting down abruptly um one of the most interesting challenges we used to get and we used to shout at AWS for this is their EVS volume so there so we use RDS to host the database and then EBS volume used to keep flipping right and it used to keep crashing and then it it used to lead to our realiz that because of the size of infrastructure it's bound to happen and you have to be ready with that right like what do you do to make sure that you are not impacted much right so interest all right so not F face challenges AWS is not able to handle our load yet or our bandwidth yet it was actually not AWS is not able to handle it's like it could be because AWS is pretty vast and our traffic is not as much as like I was giving an example of what we did at what I did at Amazon the thing is that you cannot consider your infrastructure to be always up and running correct when your infra size is large things going down is much more C you cannot think of it as an exceptional event it's not exception it's a normal you have to be okay with that so that was our biggest learning thing being prepared for things going wrong having a fall back having a right that we had to ensure across all of our services also that was pretty interesting and challenging very cool cool U 5 years at an academy then Google back to Big Tech back to Big yeah big Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah I joined Google I was uh India for data Pro Data proess managed EOS system man SP what actually unfortunately fortunately people have AWS in so gcp equalent of that is data right so I was part of performance uh gcp data performance so we used to take care of uh making sure that Apaches Park that we run runs the best on gcp so we used to manipulate Apaches those Vari of apach spark add our patches to it and make it hyper optimized to run on gcp workloads all right so this way our customers get best service we don't use things out of the box from open source right we optimize it for uh our Hardware our infrastructure and then pass on the benefits to the customers so I was IND for data all right had you worked on similar problems before never so I I have to learn on the even at I was doing search I never worked on search at practor I worked on devops I never work I never started a server right then at Amazon I was doing colding of big data I never worked on that uh an academy search never worked on notification never worked on feed but again for me it was plus I never managed a team I never built a team from ground up uh never did inra rotation so there are a lot of things that were new almost always but having that right to learn what's so tough in it nothing tough like you just have to put in the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro in it it's just the time spent in that doain that's the only difference I agree if I spend enough time same time as that person I would be able to know the same things the same set of things maybe even better right maybe even more than what that person knows so with that it was easier for me to like that was the mindset that I I've always operated on right makes sense that that leads to two questions U one is how was your interview process at these companies considering yeah that's the first question so one thing I realize is it's all about how you communicate during intervie how how strong is your conviction H now most people they fear or they're intimidated by oh my God this is something new I will not be able to do it but if you showcase a high conviction in my case because of my personality because of my slightly Ecentric personality I'm able to radiate confidence better I'm able to speak better so it's about if I have high conviction that I'll figure it out M then the hiring manager also has a high conviction all okay and the inter process is almost always like they judge you on your problem solving skills and this and that if you're able to articulate your thoughts well you're able to solve the problems that have been asked in the interview you'll 100% be able to uh crack the inter definitely Stu is going there and making an impact that takes time so you cannot Bluff you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you are able to make an impact after you join right so you cannot lie over here so your conviction needs to be high but backed by your past achievements right it cannot be like any not to up then you lose your job right so this is something that I always tell people that you should radiate confidence you should have High conviction in your abilities but it should be backed by your past data right been there done that for and whatnot with Awards recognitions impact output outcome some and uh interview process mostly this and they see how Keen you are into solving this problem most people are not keen tackling the new new challenge most I I worked on search I'll solve search I worked on this I done this now imagine how many people in India or even in the world would be there who are working on open source Apaches part and optimizing its performance you cannot expect this kind of work to be like you cannot expect to find people who have done similar work right right right right possible prodop you can still find people with similar experience for this obscure type thing it's incredibly difficult which is where your first principle thinking right your at to solve problems and all of that K in so interview difference is more about you showing your faith and them reciprocating in the right s and again it's their responsibility to evaluate better right if they have made a bad call hiring me for example they would change their interess right either I either I or they learn yeah the second question here is will very relevant for people people get very over with the new technology so you know I think if I ask most people here they'll be like they're going to judge me on impact so how do you think you did that how do you think that is the thought process of people I think people don't generally like computer science most of them said everybody has an inclination right but why do you think people have that attitude I think it's more like they confident in cracking interviews because it's cracking an interview is sort of rigged right at some point it's it's like preparing examination yeah you always Tau to prepare well for examination and that's end of story exactly you never told that's a situation so most people one I realiz is we are all taught to study a fixed syllabus M crack an exam join a college or join a job what people feel in college exact same thing they feel at job okay how do I differentiate yeah how do I crack marks how do I do this college m still is there also you have like different examinations to crack marks soob people try to manipulate or they try to have this as de [Music] they draw right right right so everything so which is why bu for the problem it's in two parts first is startups and second is Big Tech right now big Tech process is very uh strategized it's very form you exactly know okay these five things I'm supposed to do and this is the rating I would get right so that's why good students always do well at Big because they exactly know what they Ching you have to have you have to be owner of at least one service you have to drive business impact of at least one if it's not written then manager would tell them because manager people are because manager is also chasing some goals correct correct so good students do very well at Big Texs you there is a structure right there is a checklist that you are following exactly very similar to your checklist during your college days and during your exam preparation phas but things become very interesting when it's a startup when it's ambiguous when manager know and priorties keep shifting and this and that this is where people will find the hardest and to be honest more people work in these type of companies than big Tech correct correct so which is why most people find it hard so one thing I always tell key it does not matter the the lines of quote that you have shipped what is stable is it driving the impact it is supposed to because I've known I've known a person who has built three killer features but none of them worked guess if that person would have gotten a promotion or not I would assume no no again was that person's fault no but it was a collective failure of for examp you're there you win your team wins you cannot say because your the outcome see output is in your control outcome is not in your exactly outcome is a collective effort it's Collective effort of entire Team Management leadership business marketing everything right so whatever is in your control you do your best and then because in my case also there have been two products that have been completely scraped after I work on it for 8 months did I whine about it I feel bad but then I had to make sure that I am having enough other impactful stuff right and people need to understand and people find it difficult because they are amb envirment they don't find it right so having an ability to spot he this is impactful or this is the bare minimum efforts I would drive the max impact and I could go above and beyond here is important I'll give a simple example like Extreme Concrete example is um let's say I know my project is going nowhere now what should what should I do I know that this project is doomed to fail and I know I would not be getting a promotion what should you do one okay here are ideas you talk to your manager manager probably manag you are being so p you are seeing it your manager is not seeing it exactly so that that part is closed second is I would just make sure have some other impact that I can show but then manag would say your your entire should be here yeah third option is you try to improve your visibility in the same time right company TI talk though ah okay help other people Mentor few folks make help others will you are collecting your browny points this is at one point this is literally what I did really okay I would assum at Pig Tech not start up start so because if you see that something might not work you have to start working on your plan B much sooner right right without telling other people that this is my plan right and without you showcasing your disinterest or your pism because if you show your pessimism people working with you will become negative yeah you should be very this that and what without putting yourself in bad books you have to still drive in back because obious Seasons because this project is important for organization so you start working on Parallel things right at least because then you that you could not have done if you were busy if this was impactful very high focus you could not have done that right so use that time to drive other things and that's how you still make sure that throughout your Span in your organization wherever you are working you have something impactful every month coming out right it may be your direct work it may be your indirect work through mentorship and all it could be your visibility thing it could be your influence it could be your new process that you have introduced so you have to make sure that you are making you're delivering enough impact right in one year talking about appraisals and promotions so I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact show it grow um but like Tech is very rewarding um even if you're working you know in India only us it's very reporting even in India so what do you think if someone is you know growing up the pyramid correctly paying their debts doing everything right and growing up to the pyramid how much money can they retire with in India uh you know humbly if they're working not taking any random bets they weren't early at zato and that IPO they w at a Google and Amazon um you know paid their debts so typically salaries based salaries would cap software around 1C even for a descent if you take that as ceiling 1C is a ceiling that someone would hit uh to one CR for 5 years would be almost negligible expenses and all so roughly five to six like would end up making a million dollars right 7 to8 CR on a above average basis right right so if you're investing right and if you're you know just doing a job and I would assume there are stocks on top yeah so if you add that up um by the time you retire you're probably pretty comfortable yeah most people would be extremely comfortable you just need one big Tech experience or a well-known startup experience in your resume within first 7 to 8 years okay then it's a smooth sailing after that go then even if you do average or above average at least you'll get interview you keep making you'll keep consistently making that bare minimum amount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till 4045 in Tech got and last question let's talk about what you're doing right now so you left Google 6 months ago I left in January it's almost 11 months now 10 months now January 6th I left Google oh God so the clock is scking you told me in a year you can join Google back in a year yeah without an interview yeah clock is scking um what I'm up to is uh I I left Google to start a different company with Krishna I built uh I I started with d which was supposed to be LinkedIn for people in Tech I realized AI is coming people are copy pasting from chat GPT this is not going to work so then we pivoted into profile building and then we pivoted into interviews I don't relate much with interviews so that's why I Ste down I'm still playing a technical adviser role for them MH and then I had a side project dice DB it started as a redis replacement uh two and a half years back and now I've reignited that project again reuven he I got a unique Insight after studying papers 6 months straight every single weekend going through so many databases Source Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress a bit of it and then got that one unique Insight he this is one unique Insight that no other database in the world has literally no other database and this is one audacious problem that I want to solve right so right now now as of today I don't know what lies in the future but as of today I on a mission to solve one of the hardest problem in computer science sounds fancy I'm I'm a sales person now so there are two hard things in computer science naming things and cash inv validation we want to make second one OB okay so that's the Mission Vision we are chasing MH and uh we will be a super cach um our hypothesis is today every single microservice has its own transactional DV and has its own cach correct we don't want like each micros service having a trans DP makes sense because that's a source of Truth correct but what we hypothesize is that cash should be common across all services the reason is that if I want to if one service wants to access cash data of another service they should be able to directly access it rather than them stitching another data pipeline to replicate the more most recent changes here corre it should happen directly right so that's a fundamental shift in architecture we bringing from a m topology to a star topology where everybody talks to this and this will be horizontally scalable sharded bed all the buzz words that you can think of right it's right here all right and yeah that's what I'm on it's a fun problem to very cool um one last question I will ask so this specific project now you you're building almost database or a cache as you mentioned uh how did you gain enough knowledge and insights to be able to do that and now your answer is going to be read through code bases but how does something else okay tell me the answer is not through Cod the answer is learning on the go okay so again most people operate like that perfectionist in reality they are not right right right they want I'll read Sudan I'll read this five books and this 15 books and this blog and this thing and then I'll start building it you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes and then figuring out things on the go and it's a very cliche thing but and now I'm an entrepreneur and I feel it it's literally like jumping off the airplane and then you're stitching your parachute on while you are jumping right right while you are falling down and you are being scared every two months we change our vision of figure out something so you have to have that Knack of solving problem and like for example I never implemented right ahead l in my life but I had to do it so I went through open figure out what it does how it does wrote the code understood performance Chang it and then implemented so you being able to figure out the figure out t [Music] and this is true for almost all fields and all all domains and common all entrepreneurs but especially for engineering folks this is must this is not just for entrepreneurship but even for you know when you are working having an ability to Knack interesting challenges or interesting Solutions or hacks and all are in a more situation my been learning what the wor will be it will be not perform right for then it's it later just make sure that the code is extensible your code is plugable let say the volum interpretation I was talking about I wrote an abstract wall that does ball across sqlite also and across up and file also supp up and only file is not perform and I figure out another I just have to implement those three methods correct and then so being aware that what you are writing might not be most performant and being and making your code flexible enough to accommodate fut maybe let's say let's say 20x okay and I might not be able to take it to 50x ever right but if this product does well and I hire a person whose job is to optimize it can take it to 100 correct right need production everything Cod is not right that's the best part of our right you can always Circle back and change the things and all so that's the attitude and that's the difference is what I felt a lot of people are they they are self constrained it's not you start writing code you realize how easy it is correct exactly if you don't write code you always think it's very difficult yep I I agree 100% I think the practically start well guys lastly is great at giving challenges you have a challenge for the audience some random question that you know there's a quirky answer to I have a very interesting question let's see again folks who are watching this it's a very it's a very qu question the question is um you have to write off you have to you don't have to write a function you have to write the signature of a sorting function okay the function Declaration of a sorting function function you can pass array also link list also okay but you don't know if it's are or link list okay okay so in the function body you cannot have an if if AR do this if link list do this you cannot do that okay you have to write the signature of the function such that you pass it an AR it will sort it you pass it in link you pass in a link list it will s I just want signature of the function I don't even want the function the function implementation some level of overriding uh things like equal to imagine no it's C language nor okay list is a specific data structure we have created and in any way you would pass both of them as pointers actually you acting a void start correct correct it could be an err pointer it could be this what would be your function signature and if possible as an extension what would your implementation then without and your Cod should not have if this do this if this do this right so day day I have I have an idea but stop you have anything else for the audience anything you want to share last parting thoughts parting thoughts be curious yeah have right attitude most people uh stop being curious nobody should stop being curious I very childlike uh a lot of people don't take me seriously because of that and it's totally fine so long as I'm not losing the smile on my face I'm happy I'm making money and that's what matters but one thing that has helped me reach where I have reached is because of my curiosity and high bias for Action right because curios but if you're not acting on so a lot of people have started losing their cuity and I'm seeing that happening so just want to reinstate that fact cu the do is beautiful fall in love with her do and just dig deeper it's the best thing amazing with that I hope to see some of you at the top of the pyramid I'll see you guys in the next one bye-bye thanks thank that's why you need compar that's syst so if it's you don't need a compar you know that but you need to know how to access data now follow question the function that you're passing in is how you e the right and you know Cas of list the element I need need to be element right below it before it the thing is you don't care about complex here the key thing was abstraction like how we thinking of abstraction like finding the things which are different and then abstracting them out to either passing off a function or passing an argument or something Have function so it's add could be anything basically so three functions abstractor slapping index and 15 20 minutes able to and he knew that I was going to figure it out so they as me I this question Stay With Me Something I was always like you never anticipate questions [Applause] [Music]

then you switch to there go for 5 years for 5 years I was pretty early to join there uh 2018 f is when I joined and left in 2022 importantly how a company transitions well by the time we could react you already a billion dollar you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes right now as of today you I I don't know what playes in the future but as of today I have on a mission to solve one of the hardest problems in computer science so you cannot laugh you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you able to make talking about appraisals and promotions I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact thr it grow but like Tech is very rewarding the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro it is just the time spent 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected 6.5 and that thing hurts me because all right hi everyone and welcome to a new podcast today we have arpit arpit how's it going all going good yeah thanks for having me thanks for having me thank you for traveling so far uh arpit was here to meet the super 30 folks for the people who don't know arpit has had an interesting journey we'll talk about it uh but recently he was telling me currently he's trying out a startup if it doesn't work out his plan is to go back to Google as a principal if it doesn't work out his plan sees to go to any company in India because all of his students are staff engineers at various companies in India that's the kind of person you're talking to there's this pyramid analogy that he gave a while back uh this isn't the pyramid this is the pyramid it's extremely flat by which I mean there a lot of people at the bottom but staff level principal level L it's really hard to find the right people he was telling me there's this opening in Google open for eight months so I'm going to call this the pyramid talk understanding how can you grow up the pyramid sd1 level or you know pressure level how do you stay the middle of the pyramid to make sure you don't get filtered out as you grow up with that arpit yeah thanks for thank for summarizing it but one change it's not fallback is not principal engineer engineer but the fallback is Staff engineer at Google but everything else is true 100% it's definitely much more tapered pyramid it's it's sorry it's not extremely tapered it's very flat at top right so yeah very few good people at the top perfect soit would love to know your journey from the starting when did you join College I joined in 2008 and uh graduated in 2012 then did my Ms in 2013 to5 okay and what were your colleges my uh graduation College was College of Engineering Pune and my masters was from triple Hyderabad all right very cool oh Tri Hyderabad I'm assuming is a good college very good one of the best outs you in the country yeah so did you feel that difference between bachelors and Masters so fortunately my graduation College was also good uh it is maharashtra's best college uh the kind of exposure I got during my college time was invaluable both during my graduation and during my masters the one change or another two key things that changed during my masters was number one uh the importance of coding culture which I did not have in my graduation college and the and the second thing was the importance of research culture which again was lacking in my btech college so that exposure was really nice uh unfortunately a lot of people who do Masters in India do it for placement purposes so the crowd had some like the core motivation of crowd was different the core motivation of crowding my B College was different but people who wanted to leverage the way they would want they have leveraged the Master's beautiful and the graduation beautifully but the difference is is there my B and master col all right would you say that was worth it going for a masters spending three years uh if you do your Masters within 3 years yes after 3 years no okay because it's not worth it given if like if your soul a is to get a job or let's say go to us or something it's better to crack and then do an internal switch without you losing your salary or having the 2-year career break you can uh reach to the position where you want to but if you think that or or other your motivation is to go deeper into your subjects deeper into your domain and whatnot Master is really good uh but you have to be very clear with your goal because you know there will be people having placement I have job job job internship internship internship placement placement placement but then if you look at them and then you decide that such you could have done job and then made an internal switch to a different country or different company and whatnot right so in my case my intention was to first of all get a good brand on my resum I be brutally honest second was to uh because what happened is after my graduation um I was working for a company called Sapa softwares my wife my then girlfriend now wife worked at basically Delhi MC M Bangalore and I applied and uh they offered 9 LPA my college after a year when I applied and wanted to join there I got selected and the offered 6.5 oh and that thing hurts me because it was not the disparity it was basically the parity that happened because of my college of graduation I was under assumption mra's best college but no one in Bangalore knew that and that hit me hard I also bang at that time and they not my resume and I realized and that was the thinging hey I need a good brand on my resume and I still need to pursue my passion for engineering which is where uped for gate and joined trip Hyderabad because they have their own entrance exam I did like 500 rank in Gate uh 300 or 500 something I was getting it g at that time I go at that time but then I chose to appear for triple it exam cracked it and then joined that college and then made the most I could two years right on very cool so you graduated in 2015 so uh bch 2012 Masters 2015 all right I would assume after 2015 your fresher Journey started again I was a associate software engineer at D that's how it started yeah all right oh so your first offer was deaw yeah and I it in a month and a half in in a month and a half yeah interesting yeah I'm too quick to judge what was what was what did you not like about Finance no it was not about domain it was about the work that I was doing okay like even if I imagine you doing your Masters and then writing web Scrappers not so I was part of front office part of oil Natural Gas and energy sector so my job my job and my tech lead's job also was to scrape energy websites get the latest prices and then inest it in the database for Brokers to use right like no not going to happen not going to do this for like 1 2 3 4 5 years of my life I immediately made a switch to pra and pror was aggressively hiring I a lot of people from trip went toor right right right and then I joined devop and then life took care of itself you said in practce you started to devops yeah oh super interesting so okay I would love to know more about this so you uh I would assume in college how much devops did you do zero zero I did not even know how server what is a server how it starts what is a web server how it connect I have no idea I just learned it on the go I go it so prao was a startup back then I was very fast Peak at the 2015 2016 got it so how did you learn on the job how did you make your learning curve so high while you were there so to be honest in for me what the fuel was simple that although I graduated in 2012 I was still a fresher in 2015 so effectively I did my btech for seven years right right so I had to make up right for because I was not making any money at that time one year I job one year of job I did I put it in my mtech fees so I had to cover up because my batches were already senior software engineers and some of them were teches so I had to over compensate and because I had to over compensate I'll go all in worked really hard made an impact got my first promotion in 6 months so I was one of the two or three freshers who got promoted out of batch of 50 50 or 60 freshes they hired and two or three got promoted I was one of them me a Bazar Raja I remember three of us definitely who got promoted at that time and and confidence although the doain was entirely new but I still did it and one of the key highlights that was there was how although I was part of devops I was also part of an internal JavaScript regulation team I had no idea of JavaScript but my first principle thinking my thought process my attitude uh I built internal portals and whatnot at that time react was just picking up and I started learning it it's fun although it's not supposed to be done by a devop but I was still doing it and seeing that I was part of a internal team for JS Guild where we like one F from each team like we were like seven eight people team who were regulating JavaScript usage in the organization that hey which packages should you use will do the vulnerability checking this that everybody will download package from the same Source not from the standard npm right and whatnot got it so the great thing was I never said throughout my experience and then I started climbing up ladder much faster because of that very cool uh do you remember any experiences of I don't know good things that you saw at prao good challenges that you got introduced to U considering the scale of the company back then yeah so at prao um I was handling entire infrastructure so I was handling uh Dev infrastructure and in the later half of my uh sprinted PR I was Al handling a bit of production so one of the key things that I learned there was how to manage elastic search cluster so pract did not use a managed offering used to run elastic search cluster on ec2 instances at that time so what I had to do was I learned it first and then applied it that how do you Ure how do you handle Hot Shot problem what if one of The Shard is becoming piping H because of all the load that is coming in how do you solve it how do you balance and all those Concepts that I learned while managing my own cluster that helps it still helps me when I am doing database migration and I'm doing anything else because the underlying Concepts exactly the same that is one very cool uh and you worked at pror for two years one and a half year one and a half year what was your next switch that was Amazon Amazon oh interesting okay so Finance to Startup toig and then I moved to so Amazon Hyderabad was there I was part of team called Fast data Technologies so fast data so we used to take care of cold tearing of hot data so let's say their main database is transactional database let's say hypothetical example it's MyQ it was not my SQL but let's take example of my SQL is a hot storage now what we used to do was we used to take data out and move it to a cold tier which is S3 okay more important it's not Arch most people think I moving data to S3 it's archive it's not archive i have to seamlessly be able to query across the data right be it hot TI be it cold tier okay we do this to say cost mhm so we were one of the largest customers of S3 like my small team was one of the largest customers of S3 like we were competing directly with Netflix with respect to the amount of data we save oh wow so that's the scale of Amazon and I just learned it while it was there what it takes to do this and whatnot so we used to run job jobs that used to download that used to extract the data transform it a bit create M database store it on S3 and more importantly not losing an ability to query the data you could see this in example as if you use Amazon app uh you go to orders page and you see your past orders the most recent six month orders come from hot storage when you do it change it and like that was literally our customer okay so when you change it uh before 6 months that all comes from S3 all right so that is the hot storage and Cold Storage uh that we did at that time very cool how how are you querying from S3 directly how would you run so that's the thing so that is where you have to store your data in a way that you have indexes on your ec2 instances because you still have to query it you will not be storing the data on E2 ins you'll be storing indexes on E2 ins kind of and then uh when you make a request it comes to a central router that router checks the hot storage if it has the data it Serv it if not it comes to Cold Storage Cold Storage is one of the servers that server has the data great it serves it if not goes through SD gets the data caches it for some time and then serves it so but that when you're doing this on S3 it's not you can think of it as nine implementation is one file for each order M but then you would have so many files correct which is just impractical so which is where you have to create a bunch of embedded databases where you store this key value store in a efficient format and that small index is loaded here so that you still know where to go and read the data and then serve it so without losing an ability to query the data on S3 so we have we did pointed reads of a fraction of data within a file on S3 all right so you save a ton of money that scale of Amazon Super same all right oh that's Prett cool so saying most data that's archival in Amazon things like past orders some of it comes from hot storage a lot of it is S3 I would assume most of it a lot majority of them is because you're very likely to query your most recent order yeah and not so likely to query your older order so all of that comes from us very cool uh so this was your work at Amazon any other interesting project you worked on Amazon was this all right then you switch to there go for five years for five years five years yeah okay I was pretty to join there uh 2018 FB is when I joined and left in 2022 2018 FB so what were your what number employee were you on in the tech team my employee ID was 1 123 oh wow it went like a it like a dummy ID when I used to say this everybody used Tock right so my employ C was 123 I was mostly 12th 12th or 13th person in Tech oh wow very early so I started I started handling search okay there buil entire search ground up uh then looked at then while I was mentoring back end folks here and there doing Cod reviews I was a senior most person in the at that time oh so a lot of stuff uh had to be handled and all quite fun time um then I joined as a technical architect there uh slightly loaded title Butch architect I got and I was mentoring backend people I was handling search search a bit of gamification and uh mentorship optimization datab optimization and all but a lot of my energy was on search then I built notification center Ina notification center uh Pura and then I transition into leadership role okay into eing management then I built search sorry then I built s team ground up again my dev's experience at pror helped me and I buil entire team count up and then I took also took care of data engineering team five years passed gradu move to Google nice good times unacademy was my best experience so far okay undoubtedly when it comes to people learning job what what was the best part about unacademy working there to be honest it sound cringy but yeah everything because uh it never felt like it was someone else's company I never felt like an employee never always took but deep inside I knew how much I cared for the product how much I car for the company to win so I still remember every Friday s used to go down me and my friend becauseas we used to work and come and make it uh make it up and rning again while Tech we used to have game nights every Friday and every Friday while that game night was happening the search used to go down because of the peak traffic that we used to get right and then we sat once and for all so yeah people were amazing uh Tech was very nice I learned a lot of hacks there that um and since then I've been saying this um what matters is business product and then engineering engineering is always an unbl right nobody cares about a solid principle liquid principle gas principle if your business is not surviving cor or if your business is not driving you don't have a good product so I understood the importance of that and more importantly how company transitions no from a very small company a little startup and then when venture capital is infused and a huge venture capital is infused what it takes for you to operate at massive scale well by the time we could react we were already a billion dollar and then so many [Music] people so much of stuff that were happening that it was becoming difficult more difficult by the day to manage it but then that was my learning thing let's build deep ground up now already has an experience come an em and build a team right and so on so for so it was very nice combination uh but again the curse of becoming bigger prior like things we used to say now becomes official Gade and that is something that we did not like it much like all the old folks we like better off we would do it right so a lot of those things scpt up but that was a good learning that you understand how a company Transitions and you have to adapt to it you cannot just say it anything will still be chaotic right at that skill you have to have those processes if you don't have processes you know what all things can go wrong so that was very good uh learning not just from coding coding side but also from what it takes to build a team scal team importance of processes um setting up right processes security practices zero trust on employees so that was very nice very cool uh yeah I lot to talk about your journey there considering I'm assuming when you joined the devop pipeline was very janky and by the time you left I would assume since it was a company you know everything was stable as you said employee management things like these Journey first I'm assuming you L it an academ is also one product this is when you open any Tex page yeah when it comes to the front end when it comes to their you know if you've seen their live video you've probably seen it never seen a better one everyone else uses Zoom unacademy has its own live true so would love to know I don't know about the product was great one of the best products the secret source of an academy was the passion of people the people who are building it never again I I again repeat he we all never felt it was someone else's company we all were very proud of what we were building so first years was like the best for us we never thought we built video calling for educator payments part unacademy subscription was when we were there like entire business model changing we saw impact of business model nobody had done subscriptions in N Tech anad was the first one to subscriptions in Tech right so that was fa and because we were so engrossed with the vision and we felt our vision plus we had some very amazing designers and all they the found then gave then the business sorry then the product design guidelines were so in place that everybody stuck to what was part of the uh guidelines and all and it was very well taught so him kov both are extremely focused on on Crafting great user experience and that is shown through and through produ development life cycle engineering was our passion busing then we also we Cann make cor it very cool uh do you can you talk about the infrastructure at unacademy finally by the time you left or is that IND infrastructure is it what inra size of infra where did you guys deployed what cloud what technology it was all AWS all AWS we already have blocks I'm not spilling the VIN here it's all out there we were on AWS uh completely on AWS we had uh almost no plans of moving out because of the tight coupling of our services deployment Frameworks and what not with AWS and and that was primarily our infra um multi- region yes uh Singapore was our primary monolithic region and live classes were driven from Mumbai okay because when an academy started Mumbai data center wasn't there right so that's why all the services all the backend Services were in uh Singapore got it while live classes because of minimizing latency were all in Mumbai these were like key different key difference uh sizing and all was above average than most companies in India U we are playing a pretty hefty amount to AWS as our monthly bill which was pretty interesting I never thought but that was that was a big learning and more importantly that when you have this big of an infra it's one of my biggest St was it's not the matter of what goes wrong it's matter of where it goes [Music] wrong yeah if you assume let's say one in one year goes down one time on average so when you have a massive infra it's not the matter of what it's matter of when when it will go down and you have to be prepared for things going wrong things shutting down abruptly um one of the most interesting challenges we used to get and we used to shout at AWS for this is their EVS volume so there so we use RDS to host the database and then EBS volume used to keep flipping right and it used to keep crashing and then it it used to lead to our realiz that because of the size of infrastructure it's bound to happen and you have to be ready with that right like what do you do to make sure that you are not impacted much right so interest all right so not F face challenges AWS is not able to handle our load yet or our bandwidth yet it was actually not AWS is not able to handle it's like it could be because AWS is pretty vast and our traffic is not as much as like I was giving an example of what we did at what I did at Amazon the thing is that you cannot consider your infrastructure to be always up and running correct when your infra size is large things going down is much more C you cannot think of it as an exceptional event it's not exception it's a normal you have to be okay with that so that was our biggest learning thing being prepared for things going wrong having a fall back having a right that we had to ensure across all of our services also that was pretty interesting and challenging very cool cool U 5 years at an academy then Google back to Big Tech back to Big yeah big Tech started big Tech yeah so yeah I joined Google I was uh India for data Pro Data proess managed EOS system man SP what actually unfortunately fortunately people have AWS in so gcp equalent of that is data right so I was part of performance uh gcp data performance so we used to take care of uh making sure that Apaches Park that we run runs the best on gcp so we used to manipulate Apaches those Vari of apach spark add our patches to it and make it hyper optimized to run on gcp workloads all right so this way our customers get best service we don't use things out of the box from open source right we optimize it for uh our Hardware our infrastructure and then pass on the benefits to the customers so I was IND for data all right had you worked on similar problems before never so I I have to learn on the even at I was doing search I never worked on search at practor I worked on devops I never work I never started a server right then at Amazon I was doing colding of big data I never worked on that uh an academy search never worked on notification never worked on feed but again for me it was plus I never managed a team I never built a team from ground up uh never did inra rotation so there are a lot of things that were new almost always but having that right to learn what's so tough in it nothing tough like you just have to put in the difference between someone starting and someone quote unquote Pro in it it's just the time spent in that doain that's the only difference I agree if I spend enough time same time as that person I would be able to know the same things the same set of things maybe even better right maybe even more than what that person knows so with that it was easier for me to like that was the mindset that I I've always operated on right makes sense that that leads to two questions U one is how was your interview process at these companies considering yeah that's the first question so one thing I realize is it's all about how you communicate during intervie how how strong is your conviction H now most people they fear or they're intimidated by oh my God this is something new I will not be able to do it but if you showcase a high conviction in my case because of my personality because of my slightly Ecentric personality I'm able to radiate confidence better I'm able to speak better so it's about if I have high conviction that I'll figure it out M then the hiring manager also has a high conviction all okay and the inter process is almost always like they judge you on your problem solving skills and this and that if you're able to articulate your thoughts well you're able to solve the problems that have been asked in the interview you'll 100% be able to uh crack the inter definitely Stu is going there and making an impact that takes time so you cannot Bluff you cannot like that that cannot happen you have to make sure that you are able to make an impact after you join right so you cannot lie over here so your conviction needs to be high but backed by your past achievements right it cannot be like any not to up then you lose your job right so this is something that I always tell people that you should radiate confidence you should have High conviction in your abilities but it should be backed by your past data right been there done that for and whatnot with Awards recognitions impact output outcome some and uh interview process mostly this and they see how Keen you are into solving this problem most people are not keen tackling the new new challenge most I I worked on search I'll solve search I worked on this I done this now imagine how many people in India or even in the world would be there who are working on open source Apaches part and optimizing its performance you cannot expect this kind of work to be like you cannot expect to find people who have done similar work right right right right possible prodop you can still find people with similar experience for this obscure type thing it's incredibly difficult which is where your first principle thinking right your at to solve problems and all of that K in so interview difference is more about you showing your faith and them reciprocating in the right s and again it's their responsibility to evaluate better right if they have made a bad call hiring me for example they would change their interess right either I either I or they learn yeah the second question here is will very relevant for people people get very over with the new technology so you know I think if I ask most people here they'll be like they're going to judge me on impact so how do you think you did that how do you think that is the thought process of people I think people don't generally like computer science most of them said everybody has an inclination right but why do you think people have that attitude I think it's more like they confident in cracking interviews because it's cracking an interview is sort of rigged right at some point it's it's like preparing examination yeah you always Tau to prepare well for examination and that's end of story exactly you never told that's a situation so most people one I realiz is we are all taught to study a fixed syllabus M crack an exam join a college or join a job what people feel in college exact same thing they feel at job okay how do I differentiate yeah how do I crack marks how do I do this college m still is there also you have like different examinations to crack marks soob people try to manipulate or they try to have this as de [Music] they draw right right right so everything so which is why bu for the problem it's in two parts first is startups and second is Big Tech right now big Tech process is very uh strategized it's very form you exactly know okay these five things I'm supposed to do and this is the rating I would get right so that's why good students always do well at Big because they exactly know what they Ching you have to have you have to be owner of at least one service you have to drive business impact of at least one if it's not written then manager would tell them because manager people are because manager is also chasing some goals correct correct so good students do very well at Big Texs you there is a structure right there is a checklist that you are following exactly very similar to your checklist during your college days and during your exam preparation phas but things become very interesting when it's a startup when it's ambiguous when manager know and priorties keep shifting and this and that this is where people will find the hardest and to be honest more people work in these type of companies than big Tech correct correct so which is why most people find it hard so one thing I always tell key it does not matter the the lines of quote that you have shipped what is stable is it driving the impact it is supposed to because I've known I've known a person who has built three killer features but none of them worked guess if that person would have gotten a promotion or not I would assume no no again was that person's fault no but it was a collective failure of for examp you're there you win your team wins you cannot say because your the outcome see output is in your control outcome is not in your exactly outcome is a collective effort it's Collective effort of entire Team Management leadership business marketing everything right so whatever is in your control you do your best and then because in my case also there have been two products that have been completely scraped after I work on it for 8 months did I whine about it I feel bad but then I had to make sure that I am having enough other impactful stuff right and people need to understand and people find it difficult because they are amb envirment they don't find it right so having an ability to spot he this is impactful or this is the bare minimum efforts I would drive the max impact and I could go above and beyond here is important I'll give a simple example like Extreme Concrete example is um let's say I know my project is going nowhere now what should what should I do I know that this project is doomed to fail and I know I would not be getting a promotion what should you do one okay here are ideas you talk to your manager manager probably manag you are being so p you are seeing it your manager is not seeing it exactly so that that part is closed second is I would just make sure have some other impact that I can show but then manag would say your your entire should be here yeah third option is you try to improve your visibility in the same time right company TI talk though ah okay help other people Mentor few folks make help others will you are collecting your browny points this is at one point this is literally what I did really okay I would assum at Pig Tech not start up start so because if you see that something might not work you have to start working on your plan B much sooner right right without telling other people that this is my plan right and without you showcasing your disinterest or your pism because if you show your pessimism people working with you will become negative yeah you should be very this that and what without putting yourself in bad books you have to still drive in back because obious Seasons because this project is important for organization so you start working on Parallel things right at least because then you that you could not have done if you were busy if this was impactful very high focus you could not have done that right so use that time to drive other things and that's how you still make sure that throughout your Span in your organization wherever you are working you have something impactful every month coming out right it may be your direct work it may be your indirect work through mentorship and all it could be your visibility thing it could be your influence it could be your new process that you have introduced so you have to make sure that you are making you're delivering enough impact right in one year talking about appraisals and promotions so I think a lot of people would just get overwhelmed by this podcast again politics you know do impact show it grow um but like Tech is very rewarding um even if you're working you know in India only us it's very reporting even in India so what do you think if someone is you know growing up the pyramid correctly paying their debts doing everything right and growing up to the pyramid how much money can they retire with in India uh you know humbly if they're working not taking any random bets they weren't early at zato and that IPO they w at a Google and Amazon um you know paid their debts so typically salaries based salaries would cap software around 1C even for a descent if you take that as ceiling 1C is a ceiling that someone would hit uh to one CR for 5 years would be almost negligible expenses and all so roughly five to six like would end up making a million dollars right 7 to8 CR on a above average basis right right so if you're investing right and if you're you know just doing a job and I would assume there are stocks on top yeah so if you add that up um by the time you retire you're probably pretty comfortable yeah most people would be extremely comfortable you just need one big Tech experience or a well-known startup experience in your resume within first 7 to 8 years okay then it's a smooth sailing after that go then even if you do average or above average at least you'll get interview you keep making you'll keep consistently making that bare minimum amount right and so 5 to 6 to 7 CR is fairly comfortable for most people if they survive till 4045 in Tech got and last question let's talk about what you're doing right now so you left Google 6 months ago I left in January it's almost 11 months now 10 months now January 6th I left Google oh God so the clock is scking you told me in a year you can join Google back in a year yeah without an interview yeah clock is scking um what I'm up to is uh I I left Google to start a different company with Krishna I built uh I I started with d which was supposed to be LinkedIn for people in Tech I realized AI is coming people are copy pasting from chat GPT this is not going to work so then we pivoted into profile building and then we pivoted into interviews I don't relate much with interviews so that's why I Ste down I'm still playing a technical adviser role for them MH and then I had a side project dice DB it started as a redis replacement uh two and a half years back and now I've reignited that project again reuven he I got a unique Insight after studying papers 6 months straight every single weekend going through so many databases Source Code Red dragonfly Juno pogress a bit of it and then got that one unique Insight he this is one unique Insight that no other database in the world has literally no other database and this is one audacious problem that I want to solve right so right now now as of today I don't know what lies in the future but as of today I on a mission to solve one of the hardest problem in computer science sounds fancy I'm I'm a sales person now so there are two hard things in computer science naming things and cash inv validation we want to make second one OB okay so that's the Mission Vision we are chasing MH and uh we will be a super cach um our hypothesis is today every single microservice has its own transactional DV and has its own cach correct we don't want like each micros service having a trans DP makes sense because that's a source of Truth correct but what we hypothesize is that cash should be common across all services the reason is that if I want to if one service wants to access cash data of another service they should be able to directly access it rather than them stitching another data pipeline to replicate the more most recent changes here corre it should happen directly right so that's a fundamental shift in architecture we bringing from a m topology to a star topology where everybody talks to this and this will be horizontally scalable sharded bed all the buzz words that you can think of right it's right here all right and yeah that's what I'm on it's a fun problem to very cool um one last question I will ask so this specific project now you you're building almost database or a cache as you mentioned uh how did you gain enough knowledge and insights to be able to do that and now your answer is going to be read through code bases but how does something else okay tell me the answer is not through Cod the answer is learning on the go okay so again most people operate like that perfectionist in reality they are not right right right they want I'll read Sudan I'll read this five books and this 15 books and this blog and this thing and then I'll start building it you're almost never ready right you are never ready to get married you are never ready to become a dad you are never ready to do anything in life it's just about saying yes and then figuring out things on the go and it's a very cliche thing but and now I'm an entrepreneur and I feel it it's literally like jumping off the airplane and then you're stitching your parachute on while you are jumping right right while you are falling down and you are being scared every two months we change our vision of figure out something so you have to have that Knack of solving problem and like for example I never implemented right ahead l in my life but I had to do it so I went through open figure out what it does how it does wrote the code understood performance Chang it and then implemented so you being able to figure out the figure out t [Music] and this is true for almost all fields and all all domains and common all entrepreneurs but especially for engineering folks this is must this is not just for entrepreneurship but even for you know when you are working having an ability to Knack interesting challenges or interesting Solutions or hacks and all are in a more situation my been learning what the wor will be it will be not perform right for then it's it later just make sure that the code is extensible your code is plugable let say the volum interpretation I was talking about I wrote an abstract wall that does ball across sqlite also and across up and file also supp up and only file is not perform and I figure out another I just have to implement those three methods correct and then so being aware that what you are writing might not be most performant and being and making your code flexible enough to accommodate fut maybe let's say let's say 20x okay and I might not be able to take it to 50x ever right but if this product does well and I hire a person whose job is to optimize it can take it to 100 correct right need production everything Cod is not right that's the best part of our right you can always Circle back and change the things and all so that's the attitude and that's the difference is what I felt a lot of people are they they are self constrained it's not you start writing code you realize how easy it is correct exactly if you don't write code you always think it's very difficult yep I I agree 100% I think the practically start well guys lastly is great at giving challenges you have a challenge for the audience some random question that you know there's a quirky answer to I have a very interesting question let's see again folks who are watching this it's a very it's a very qu question the question is um you have to write off you have to you don't have to write a function you have to write the signature of a sorting function okay the function Declaration of a sorting function function you can pass array also link list also okay but you don't know if it's are or link list okay okay so in the function body you cannot have an if if AR do this if link list do this you cannot do that okay you have to write the signature of the function such that you pass it an AR it will sort it you pass it in link you pass in a link list it will s I just want signature of the function I don't even want the function the function implementation some level of overriding uh things like equal to imagine no it's C language nor okay list is a specific data structure we have created and in any way you would pass both of them as pointers actually you acting a void start correct correct it could be an err pointer it could be this what would be your function signature and if possible as an extension what would your implementation then without and your Cod should not have if this do this if this do this right so day day I have I have an idea but stop you have anything else for the audience anything you want to share last parting thoughts parting thoughts be curious yeah have right attitude most people uh stop being curious nobody should stop being curious I very childlike uh a lot of people don't take me seriously because of that and it's totally fine so long as I'm not losing the smile on my face I'm happy I'm making money and that's what matters but one thing that has helped me reach where I have reached is because of my curiosity and high bias for Action right because curios but if you're not acting on so a lot of people have started losing their cuity and I'm seeing that happening so just want to reinstate that fact cu the do is beautiful fall in love with her do and just dig deeper it's the best thing amazing with that I hope to see some of you at the top of the pyramid I'll see you guys in the next one bye-bye thanks thank that's why you need compar that's syst so if it's you don't need a compar you know that but you need to know how to access data now follow question the function that you're passing in is how you e the right and you know Cas of list the element I need need to be element right below it before it the thing is you don't care about complex here the key thing was abstraction like how we thinking of abstraction like finding the things which are different and then abstracting them out to either passing off a function or passing an argument or something Have function so it's add could be anything basically so three functions abstractor slapping index and 15 20 minutes able to and he knew that I was going to figure it out so they as me I this question Stay With Me Something I was always like you never anticipate questions [Applause] [Music]

there's a mistake young people make it's assuming that the people who know the most about the future are the tutorial makers especially the ones who create tutorials on how to land interviews how to get a job how to learn the skill just to crack the job the advice the tips the ways to think it's all wrong you follow them because you somewhat understand what they're doing you somewhat understand the domain that they're in you kind of know it and they're giving you a clear path it stops feeling random because someone's giving you a career path someone's giving you a playlist but real practitioners something I've learned over the years are not like that they run strange experiments that very few people understand they stay on top of new technology for which there aren't even mainstream jobs yet even terminology wouldn't have been created yet but the masses the people they reject these experimental it's just too unrelatable you don't understand what they're doing because it doesn't fit into the mold of being a job it doesn't fit into the mold of being a freelancer is just very strange because you don't understand it yet you take your Ang out on these people and I'm not talking about you people watching I'm talking about generally the masses I'll give you an example 2 years ago I made a video called yes AI will take your creative job this is a quite a while ago right now the world is different we know this you know I made that video because of the comments of a clip that went viral a clip of me on some podcast that went viral this was in May 2022 2.5 years ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it plays together and if you do that you end up doing a little bit better for yourself and in the last one and a half years we've done reasonably well so my main advice is I think you should stop listening to the masses to the industry to The Experts whatever it is you should not even listen to this video you should run your own experiments what has actually worked for you in life whatever it is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to actually build at least one thing you will be wrong many times lots of the things that you build with fail it's happened to me but you have to be right at least once and that's when you start doing well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in a way where you you would think this video is a path but actually I probably left you slightly more confused but in my opinion on the right path so I know I went on a bit of a tangent but in the world of rapidly advancing AI try to figure out out what people truly want the thing can now reason the thing can write the thing can really help you right but your insights need to be correct you need to be the manager who knows the market well and that will really help that's how you actually make money not what you wishfully think customers want but what they really want then you use the tool you use AI to make that and use your network or whatever distribution you end up building to sell it it's a very exciting time if you want to build stuff and sell it and as always chart your own path it's your story to write not mine not anybody else's good luck bye [Music]

there's a mistake young people make it's assuming that the people who know the most about the future are the tutorial makers especially the ones who create tutorials on how to land interviews how to get a job how to learn the skill just to crack the job the advice the tips the ways to think it's all wrong you follow them because you somewhat understand what they're doing you somewhat understand the domain that they're in you kind of know it and they're giving you a clear path it stops feeling random because someone's giving you a career path someone's giving you a playlist but real practitioners something I've learned over the years are not like that they run strange experiments that very few people understand they stay on top of new technology for which there aren't even mainstream jobs yet even terminology wouldn't have been created yet but the masses the people they reject these experimental it's just too unrelatable you don't understand what they're doing because it doesn't fit into the mold of being a job it doesn't fit into the mold of being a freelancer is just very strange because you don't understand it yet you take your Ang out on these people and I'm not talking about you people watching I'm talking about generally the masses I'll give you an example 2 years ago I made a video called yes AI will take your creative job this is a quite a while ago right now the world is different we know this you know I made that video because of the comments of a clip that went viral a clip of me on some podcast that went viral this was in May 2022 2.5 years ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the

10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it

is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to

well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in

ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it plays together and if you do that you end up doing a little bit better for yourself and in the last one and a half years we've done reasonably well so my main advice is I think you should stop listening to the masses to the industry to The Experts whatever it is you should not even listen to this video you should run your own experiments what has actually worked for you in life whatever it is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to actually build at least one thing you will be wrong many times lots of the things that you build with fail it's happened to me but you have to be right at least once and that's when you start doing well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in a way where you you would think this video is a path but actually I probably left you slightly more confused but in my opinion on the right path so I know I went on a bit of a tangent but in the world of rapidly advancing AI try to figure out out what people truly want the thing can now reason the thing can write the thing can really help you right but your insights need to be correct you need to be the manager who knows the market well and that will really help that's how you actually make money not what you wishfully think customers want but what they really want then you use the tool you use AI to make that and use your network or whatever distribution you end up building to sell it it's a very exciting time if you want to build stuff and sell it and as always chart your own path it's your story to write not mine not anybody else's good luck bye [Music]

there's a mistake young people make it's assuming that the people who know the most about the future are the tutorial makers especially the ones who create tutorials on how to land interviews how to get a job how to learn the skill just to crack the job the advice the tips the ways to think it's all wrong you follow them because you somewhat understand what they're doing you somewhat understand the domain that they're in you kind of know it and they're giving you a clear path it stops feeling random because someone's giving you a career path someone's giving you a playlist but real practitioners something I've learned over the years are not like that they run strange experiments that very few people understand they stay on top of new technology for which there aren't even mainstream jobs yet even terminology wouldn't have been created yet but the masses the people they reject these experimental it's just too unrelatable you don't understand what they're doing because it doesn't fit into the mold of being a job it doesn't fit into the mold of being a freelancer is just very strange because you don't understand it yet you take your Ang out on these people and I'm not talking about you people watching I'm talking about generally the masses I'll give you an example 2 years ago I made a video called yes AI will take your creative job this is a quite a while ago right now the world is different we know this you know I made that video because of the comments of a clip that went viral a clip of me on some podcast that went viral this was in May 2022 2.5 years ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary

so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it plays together and if you do that you end up doing a little bit better for yourself and in the last one and a half years we've done reasonably well so my main advice is I think you should stop listening to the masses to the industry to The Experts whatever it is you should not even listen to this video you should run your own experiments what has actually worked for you in life whatever it is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to actually build at least one thing you will be wrong many times lots of the things that you build with fail it's happened to me but you have to be right at least once and that's when you start doing well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in a way where you you would think this video is a path but actually I probably left you slightly more confused but in my opinion on the right path so I know I went on a bit of a tangent but in the world of rapidly advancing AI try to figure out out what people truly want the thing can now reason the thing can write the thing can really help you right but your insights need to be correct you need to be the manager who knows the market well and that will really help that's how you actually make money not what you wishfully think customers want but what they really want then you use the tool you use AI to make that and use your network or whatever distribution you end up building to sell it it's a very exciting time if you want to build stuff and sell it and as always chart your own path it's your story to write not mine not anybody else's good luck bye [Music]

there's a mistake young people make it's assuming that the people who know the most about the future are the tutorial makers especially the ones who create tutorials on how to land interviews how to get a job how to learn the skill just to crack the job the advice the tips the ways to think it's all wrong you follow them because you somewhat understand what they're doing you somewhat understand the domain that they're in you kind of know it and they're giving you a clear path it stops feeling random because someone's giving you a career path someone's giving you a playlist but real practitioners something I've learned over the years are not like that they run strange experiments that very few people understand they stay on top of new technology for which there aren't even mainstream jobs yet even terminology wouldn't have been created yet but the masses the people they reject these experimental it's just too unrelatable you don't understand what they're doing because it doesn't fit into the mold of being a job it doesn't fit into the mold of being a freelancer is just very strange because you don't understand it yet you take your Ang out on these people and I'm not talking about you people watching I'm talking about generally the masses I'll give you an example 2 years ago I made a video called yes AI will take your creative job this is a quite a while ago right now the world is different we know this you know I made that video because of the comments of a clip that went viral a clip of me on some podcast that went viral this was in May 2022 2.5 years ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was

is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or

to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it plays together and if you do that you end up doing a little bit better for yourself and in the last one and a half years we've done reasonably well so my main advice is I think you should stop listening to the masses to the industry to The Experts whatever it is you should not even listen to this video you should run your own experiments what has actually worked for you in life whatever it is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to actually build at least one thing you will be wrong many times lots of the things that you build with fail it's happened to me but you have to be right at least once and that's when you start doing well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in a way where you you would think this video is a path but actually I probably left you slightly more confused but in my opinion on the right path so I know I went on a bit of a tangent but in the world of rapidly advancing AI try to figure out out what people truly want the thing can now reason the thing can write the thing can really help you right but your insights need to be correct you need to be the manager who knows the market well and that will really help that's how you actually make money not what you wishfully think customers want but what they really want then you use the tool you use AI to make that and use your network or whatever distribution you end up building to sell it it's a very exciting time if you want to build stuff and sell it and as always chart your own path it's

there's a mistake young people make it's assuming that the people who know the most about the future are the tutorial makers especially the ones who create tutorials on how to land interviews how to get a job how to learn the skill just to crack the job the advice the tips the ways to think it's all wrong you follow them because you somewhat understand what they're doing you somewhat understand the domain that they're in you kind of know it and they're giving you a clear path it stops feeling random because someone's giving you a career path someone's giving you a playlist but real practitioners something I've learned over the years are not like that they run strange experiments that very few people understand they stay on top of new technology for which there aren't even mainstream jobs yet even terminology wouldn't have been created yet but the masses the people they reject these experimental it's just too unrelatable you don't understand what they're doing because it doesn't fit into the mold of being a job it doesn't fit into the mold of being a freelancer is just very strange because you don't understand it yet you take your Ang out on these people and I'm not talking about you people watching I'm talking about generally the masses I'll give you an example 2 years ago I made a video called yes AI will take your creative job this is a quite a while ago right now the world is different we know this you know I made that video because of the comments of a clip that went viral a clip of me on some podcast that went viral this was in May 2022 2.5 years ago I'll play the clip right now first creative jobs are going to go do you know why why any AI that you create needs training data up a construction site and take a video of the guy you know laying bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it

is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to

well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in

bricks with bricks there's a lot of Tolerance I can have the brick like 2% down 3% down doesn't matter I can have the cement I have to create so many videos of it we don't have that training data right now but if you look at thumbnail designer there is so much thumbnail data in the world right now how many thumbnails have been created on YouTube you tell me billions I can just feed that entire data to an algorithm order this by number of views the video has gotten and I will get the ultimate thumbnail make cuz the data is available online see in September 2024 this is not some revolutionary thought that AI can do Crea stuff but back then when we only had early Dar previews which I had it was considered a very inflammatory view people were like you don't understand anything about creativity the comments are mostly people abusing me as usual right telling me I don't know anything or whatever remember at this time I was already using the latest tools which at that point was just di I had used the GPT API before it become popular as a chatbot the open chatbot actually made it popular but before that you could actually use the API people forget this so that's when we had started experimenting we actually made a simple rapper to put GPD on WhatsApp we actually realized that a lot of people were using it like an assistant this was way before meta announced AI on WhatsApp by the way but we knew it would die if it worked because it was inevitable WhatsApp added an AI assistant like if it worked for us I mean of course whatsapp's going to release one right it was just so useful for people so we built more apps to keep experimenting we're like does this Mark Zuber thing right which is if you're entering a new industry don't get trapped doing something that ends up being a local Maxima keep trying things and find out where there's real opportunity where there's a big opportunity I had a hunch that AI is better for Creative tasks than accuracy based tasks so we built Alpha CTR with a fine to model at that point on stable diffusion for thumbnails for YouTube thumbnails remember in that video I said AI will replace thumbnail making well the best way to predict the future is to build it so we built it we solved a lot of very interesting problems and learned a lot of the capabilities and limits of the thing and of course if you're building a tool then you quickly come into what the limitations of the base models are we quickly learned that face swapping is not enough in fact the face has roughly three parts right features texture how your skin is all the beard parts and all that and structure while swapping sols features and textures structure needed something else and there was this interesting model at that time called dream Booth you sort of f tune a model on your likeness through a lot of pictures of view the only problem was that dream boot's outputs were good but it wasn't great so we were waiting for the next jump a couple of years later flux luras came out and with a training run of just 1,200 steps we were able to create this not just that many of our thumbnails today are actually automated with minimal or no human touch-ups this thumbnail was created with AI at least a big chunk of the thumbnail was created with AI and we knew this was possible 2 years ago because of our experiences with stable diffusion and then with dream Booth we had already experimented and only then made a prediction we knew the thing that solves this will be similar to dream Booth but better and that's exactly what it was we just waited next let's talk about agents we knew the other interesting use case of AI is as an agent where it does a bunch of series of tasks for you delegates tasks of necessary I first saw this Behavior with auto GPT so we built this tool called auto code Pro which put chat GPT or the GPT API in agent mode to write code we did this with Chrome extensions first because there's no deployment headache it was a choice we took and you know what it blew my mind it somewhat worked it wasn't perfect but some of the things that it pulled off I was like this is this is so close to what a developer would do we did a live stream on overow showing these agents in Action a long time ago and guess what yet again we got belted because Reddit didn't know the difference between GPT and an agent on GPT again I got called names as usual this seems to be a recurring habit with you know most people who are looking at a completely new domain where somebody's just running lots of experiments now 2 years later repet dropped their agent and it's really good you see our method is very painstaking it's probably the mo the hardest way to make predictions about the future because you have to run an experiment you have to build a proof of concept see how users use it and then make predictions of whether users in the future will find this useful or not it didn't come out of our and as I'm telling you the story of what we've done over the last couple of years this moment has a very important lesson it has a very important point cuz we had learned one thing about agents especially in the prompt if you ask the agent think carefully step by step weirdly it's just part of the prompt right think carefully somewhat did better in fact asking the model to explain its reasoning to you why are you doing things the way you're doing it and then correcting it was a good way to use it if you spend further time reading you can figure out why the Nobel Prize winner and psychologist Daniel kiman has a good theory for how the human brain works he claimed that there were two systems in thinking system one and system two system one is often described as operating Auto aut atically and quickly with minimal effort it relies on thumb rules and biases allowing us to make rapid judgments and decisions based on patterns we've learned over time for example when you quickly recognize a familiar face in a crowd or instinctively react to a loud noise you're using system one system two on the other hand engages in more deliberate your thinking about it it's more effortful thinking it's used for tasks that require reasoning analysis critical thinking when you solve a mathematics problem or plan a detailed project or evaluate the pros or the cons of a decision writing code whatever you're engaging system too this mode is slower and more resource intensive but essential for tasks that require careful consideration and logical analysis system one is fast system two is slow system two requires a chain of thought and when we were trying to build agents what we realized what we lacked what we really wish the underlying model had was reasoning this entire thing was reasoning we needed a system tool it wasn't thinking the entire problem through and only thinking one step ahead if you think one step ahead you don't make the best decisions what gp01 the new model that just come out really solves is system 2 in their blog post they State we've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science coding and math through training they learn to Define their thinking process try different strategies and recognize their mistakes in our tests the next model update performs similarly to PhD students on challenging Benchmark tests in physics chemistry and biology we also found that it excels in math and coding in a qualifying exam for the international mathematics Olympiad gbd 40 correctly solved only 133% of problems while the reasoning model scored 83% what a jump and if you use the model sure enough it is doing some reasoning and the reasoning is pretty good enough to solve J chemistry problems not only is this enough to give it a big boost to solving math problems but is also enough to take coding to new heights what we had learned with auto code Pro the base model needed a replacement this seems to be really good remember Deon the thing that people were calling a scam because it wasn't solving some coding problems well Devon at the time had already stated that their end to-end completion rate was 13 or 14% or something like that they already admitted that it wasn't anywhere near perfect it's a really hard problem and we've only just started but we're super excited about the progress that we've made so far but people still shat on them look at Deon scores now this is what it is with 01 as the Bas model look coding as we know it is going away I've said this so many times I keep getting attacked for it but I'll say it again coding is going away at some point which is the manual process of writing codes and remember coding is two parts one is actually thinking about the problem and think about how you'll solve the problem the second part is actually typing the code to solve the problem the second part is going away and maybe some parts of the first part Engineers will move up one role and become managers when I spoke to Imad from stable diffusion he said that this new role created by these new agents is getting good is going to be the manager of the agent very similar to the manager of people when you look at how the react Engineers operate they're not writing the react code directly you know they're using libraries so again they've had a level up already like any manager at any company and English communication knowing how to diagnose problems unblock those things sales these things become more important than just being smart yet people are sitting on the internet and fighting about DSA courses it's like are you guys blind you have to understand these new models change what it means to do work especially in software it's kind of obvious like my personal opinion on this is AI advancements are going to force people to focus more on the outcomes and just not on the inputs if someone can build an entire app in a couple of days then the only way to play is to use the same technology build it in similar time frame but now get users and revenue playing a smaller role being a small part of a a big team building a behemoth big app May phase out over time if it's trivial to build the entire app which forces all of us to Now find ways to get users and make Revenue I know it sounds scary because now you're responsible for the actual outcome now you actually have to make money to make money and I'll explain what make money to make money means today you make money of a stable salary where your company might be making money in bus on every transaction or whatever right now you'll get paid when the transaction happens because you are now much more responsible for the outcome it sounds scary but it has been the truth of humanity outside of the last 200 odd years it's always been like this farmers are not graded on what crazy farming technique or which farming framework they used but on whether the crop quality was edible almost all job roles were self-employment or apprenticeship except the Army and Court roles like the government roles of today and all these roles were judged on End Produce no hiding at a larger rug and then blaming the organization if the business fails yet knowing all this knowing that this was the nature of things you somewhat know this you still spend all your energy solving DSA to get a job I get it if you're actually picking up DSA to actually improve your own skills or improveed life sometimes that can be very valuable solving problems also improves the brain but you're doing it for a job that won't exist in the way you think it will in 5 years oan the new model is already better than 93% of people on code forces why will people pay you for the skill if it's free to solve really hard technical problems because openi is planning to put out an 01 release for free to the public in the future the weirdest thing is people complaining about me becoming a content creator in the last couple of years right because a lot of people like oh you were an engineer for 10 years then you suddenly transitioned full-time and being a content creator or whatever I made this decision 2 years ago because I was running a software company and realized features were getting commoditized I was actually in the shoes of somebody running a software company so we'd hire Engineers to solve some problems from scratch to maybe make an entire let's say thousand man streaming room but then companies like M came out and said well you can just use us inside your own platform and offer this to customers the customer doesn't care whether you built it from scratch or whether you use third party tools as long as it solves a problem that they're willing to pay for when we built a feature a competitor copied that feature in a week and then we started doing the same thing to them so we started asking ourselves what the is the m what is our defense and it was starting to dawn on me then that it started to become purely about customer Discovery trust and the customer love but mainly it was about customer Discovery it was about creating distribution so I pivoted my life very hard decision for me but I had to Pivot my life I said I'm still going to use technology but I'm going to use it to focus on building distribution that seems to be a mo where even if content gets automated the followers trust and love that you create is still valuable I said to my team and I remember this that I'm going to use AI to create software to solve problems instead of using it to sell software per se so even if I build a tool inste of selling it for $9 we'll actually focus on creating the end thing and we kept experimenting with that goal our goal of using this to create distribution and that's where the thumbnail thing came from as well and in Feb 2023 I put out a tweet we used this open source wave to lip repository and someone else's voice and dubbed my video and matched my lips with it this is a very very early version and of course it wasn't great but to me I was like if I wait 2 years on this this is going to get good same thing like we did with you know images again common people said this is stupid nobody will watch AI generated content I bet you thought this as well but the minute we did that and we saw the output we're like there is going to be a time where people don't care so much this is a prediction we made fast forward 1 year 5 month later from that tweet we did 51 million Global views on Instagram last month and another 15 million views on YouTube with 25% of this audience coming from abroad the best part is that for many of those videos it's not actually me presenting it's an AI avaa that we've spent a long time fine-tuning and perfecting both the audio as well as the video this is verun Maya he's averaging 25 million views per month but the quality so damn good most will never realize that it's not actually Veron we have the fastest news to video workflow in the world today with an AI Avatar doing the heavy lifting all the models are other people's but we fine-tuned some of them to get the results we wanted it's got an automated voice and we combined this with a manual editing team because we knew that video editing wasn't going to get automated we had tried and you know what would be really valuable if you making a lot of videos like this and you really need a video editing team to get this to happen a video editing cohort would be extremely valuable in fact we now do gen Services specifically in content and general content services for a lot of companies here are some of the customers we have worked with in the B2B element for the last 6 months alone and now suddenly Twitter is changing its tune let me read this tweet that's popular today it's by arib my hypothesis on the future of software billion dollar SAS companies are cooked marginal cost of building software products is going to zero in the next 2 years you'll be able to build any SAS tool I need need a CRM prompt 123 it's made blah blah blah blah blah and then he says TBH the real winners are going to be the content creators as number of products increase number of companies competing for the same markets and creators increase increasing the value of creators the oil of today's attention but it'll be the diamonds of tomorrow and that's exactly what I've been saying for 2 years and now suddenly it's so much cognitive dissonance for the masses distribution I thought this is some lame content creator and marketing type thing sales I have to talk to people that wasn't in syllabus but it was always true the guy selling DSA courses was successful not because of his or her skill at writing code or their skill at teaching they were successful because of distribution you misattributed why they were doing well they were doing well because they were reaching you not because they were teaching you it was clear all along their revenue lifestyle Etc was all because of distribution but you took the wrong message away you thought it was about skill that's why they're doing more and more successful in life because people knew them people were able to see them on screen and therefore they got more business they got more traction they got more customers look I'm the first to admit I'm not always right and things change for example in pajama profit the book I wrote in 2018 we had an entire chapter about how robots will take your job far before Chad GPD just so you know I've been covering openi since 2017 2018 on an old Facebook page that I've had so I've been keeping up with their early research just like I'm keeping up with robotics now but not making much content about it because it's not so exciting to the end user and it's not time yet but I'll tell you one thing that I was right about but then wrong about pajama profit was about remote work that's why it's called pajama profit pajamas at home this was much before the pandemic so remote work wasn't mainstream and of course after p pmic remote work became mainstream and we were right again but I didn't realize how much remote work slows down company when you actually Mass implemented cuz there was no way for me to know what would happen if you Mass implemented this it's fine to do remote work after you're a very successful company and doing the same thing every day but if you're shipping new products and features or specifically entering new markets or pivoting it is very bad so I was wrong not in predicting the macro trend of maybe remote work will be a thing but I didn't have the wisdom to see it play out fully because I had written this before the Pand mic and we had never seen full remote work actually play out to realize it's actually not a great thing for companies prediction was right but I changed my mind now because of new evidence but I think that prediction will be wrong in four or 5 years of course experienced companies companies that have already figured out product Market fit they will continue to work remote but it's not going to work for early stage companies so I have the humility and nuance and it takes a lot of humility to do this to change my opinions as I gain more evidence but the secret the the main secret is not even about changing your opinions as more evidence comes the secret is to not listen to the masses and right now you are listening to the masses and they're saying keep studying this this thing and this doing the same thing everything will be the same as it was 10 years ago 20 years ago it probably won't and you feel it somewhere in your gut and you're like no but the master are saying it's going to be like this so I should follow them you know the only difference between the last 2 years and the last 10 years of my life why the last two years have really taken off maybe the last one and a half years really taken off it's mostly because I stopped listening to other people it's a really hard thing to say like it's a really hard thing to implement right like you have really successful people people you work with saying no no this won't work don't do this this is stupid and still pushing past that knowing that you have that disapproval it is really hard and when you're doing it publicly as a content creator and you're saying something and then everyone's shouting at you in the comments and you're you're like okay you know am I wrong you think about it every night you're like do I still give this opinion out knowing that everyone hates me for this opinion or people think I'm completely wrong and I'm a Bose I'm an idiot but if you listen to your gut and that's the only thing that's changed in the last one and a half years which is I've stopped listening to everybody else I'm like this is what the experiment I've run tells me this is the evidence and this is what I should bet on this is what I shouldn't bet on here's how it plays together and if you do that you end up doing a little bit better for yourself and in the last one and a half years we've done reasonably well so my main advice is I think you should stop listening to the masses to the industry to The Experts whatever it is you should not even listen to this video you should run your own experiments what has actually worked for you in life whatever it is it could be completely different from what I saying I could end up being completely wrong for your circumstance in your life but you need to look at it and be like what is the experiment that I can run small experiment does it work do I like this should I be doing this and then make the decision on should you do that for a career should you learn that should you invest time in that and even if there are people telling you you're wrong you Mak a mistake blah blah blah don't listen to them especially in masses something happens to the human brain and I think the collective IQ drops or something like that or we become completely Frozen to new ideas and that's point one right which is run your own experiments make your own decisions based on those experiments nobody can solve life for you the second thing is that you probably will have to think more like a manager and you probably have to start taking responsibility for outcomes if you do those two things I think you'll be fine it's scary I can't now just charge a company money for a skill I can't just say look I'm really good at this I passed the interview give me money I now I have to create outcomes I know I'm responsible like the sales person right now you feel like engineer now feels the sales person's plight which is the salesp person actually has to close something every day or every week or whatever the customer or company demands and if he or she doesn't they lose their job now the same for everybody you can't now say on Twitter that see I am very good at this I know this and not prove it you have to actually build at least one thing you will be wrong many times lots of the things that you build with fail it's happened to me but you have to be right at least once and that's when you start doing well there are people now who have worked at unprofitable companies for years probably a decade right gone from one profit unprofitable company to another unprofitable company that era is probably going to come to an end and then the truth will become important once again not what you think is true but the truth no I feel this way emotionally so it's correct that's over I felt like that I fought with that and I'm like yo customers want something I'm nobody to fight it I can't swim against the river cuz outcomes don't care about intent or how you feel or how hard you work or that laborer would be richer than Warren Buffet outcomes care about whether you're in insights are correct if my insights about AI plus content were wrong I would have failed every successive try I've had in my life and I've tried many times I've had several bad years some good years but every successive try I've had in my life has been with much more honesty not just about myself but about what customers really want and I'm still I still make mistakes some of my experiments still don't work out it's part of the game and you need to learn that and if I fail again I will come back I'll sharpen my sword again and give people even more of what they really want that's why you must try and fail to sharpen that sword cuz otherwise you have opinions about whether to learn this or do this or do that that are untrue you haven't even tested them and the more you hope that other people on the internet give you these paths I really don't think it's going to work that's why I titled this video in a way where you you would think this video is a path but actually I probably left you slightly more confused but in my opinion on the right path so I know I went on a bit of a tangent but in the world of rapidly advancing AI try to figure out out what people truly want the thing can now reason the thing can write the thing can really help you right but your insights need to be correct you need to be the manager who knows the market well and that will really help that's how you actually make money not what you wishfully think customers want but what they really want then you use the tool you use AI to make that and use your network or whatever distribution you end up building to sell it it's a very exciting time if you want to build stuff and sell it and as always chart your own path it's your story to write not mine not anybody else's good luck bye [Music]
